Geometry utilities to performe crooked lline processing.

The crooked  line processing is done following the steps:

1. Create a binary file with the fold diagram ussing foldgraph program 
   which uses a file where the mid points are specified for each  trace. The binary file
   is a matrix of numbers which can be viwed with ximage. The mid point location for each trace 
   can be extracted form the headers by using the sugethw
2. Digitize the crooked line ussing ximage and the binary file previously
   computed.
3. Run crkcmp uses the digitized file in point 2, and the mid point location file
   used in 1. This program calculates
   the new cdp locations (coordinates) for each trace and assigns cdp number for each trace
   creates a new file with the  

XFold.sh is a test script
the example files are included.

The result from point 3, the file new-cmp.asc has to be incorporated in the trace headers
this is done through susetheader. Also provided in suBarna.
