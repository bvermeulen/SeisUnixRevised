   Beta test version of seismic-velocity overlay mode.

   Issues:

      - colorbar style.  should seismic amplitude steps be visible on
        the colorbar

      - screen does not get drawn correctly if movie running when style
        is changed.  Is this a bug?

      - should there be a color output option?  If so, how?

      - +6 offset in color map

   What other features or enhancements are needed?
