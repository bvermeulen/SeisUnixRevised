#
#         THIS MAKEFILE IS FOR INITIAL SU INSTALLS
#         It should NOT be used on a machine already running SU!!!
#
#	  The source files on the tar tape use     Mb of disk.
#	  The installed executables and libs take another     Mb of disk.
#
#	  SU now requires the following CWP libraries:
#		libcwp.a, libpar.a
#		libxplot.a, libpsplot.a
#
#         The files on the first line are distributed as "cwp" and include:
#         .../cwp, .../lib.
#         Those on the second line are distributed as "plot" and include:
#         .../xplot .../psplot
#
#	  The older SU graphics is no longer distributed, but cplot
#         and vplot.cwp are available by request.  vplot itself is
#	  available by anonomous ftp from hanauma.stanford.edu
#
#         SU now requires ANSI C compiler/include files.

#******  YOUR INPUT NEEDED ******#
#
# ROOT is the parent of the directory where you want the binary to go
# If it is acceptable to you, choose /usr/local, then the binary
# will go into /usr/local/cwp/bin, the libs into /usr/local/cwp/lib and
# the includes into /usr/local/cwp/include.
ROOT = /usr/local/cwp
#
# OPTC is the optimization flag for your C compiler (O for most)
OPTC = -O
#
#******  END INPUT--BUT KEEP READING!! THERE IS MORE TO DO!! ******#

#
#	If you don't have SEP's vplot installed, remove the vplot.cwp
#	line from the "compile" paragraph at the end of this file.
#	Also fix the Makefile in ./graphics so it doesn't try to make
#	the vplot mains.
#
#	Known problems:
#
#	    Some makes don't understand the $$@ notation and you'll
#           have to type the compile routine for each program in the group.
#           Hints are given in the makefiles for most of the vunerable
#           directories.
#
#           The codes are intended to be ANSI C.  Pre ANSI C compilers
#           are going to have a real hard time.
#           Some directories have Portability subdirectories, if you
#           seem to be missing something poke around in these directories.
#           We think that for full ANSI C compatible compilers, you won't
#           need any of this.
#
#	    Some of the shells in the ./su/shell directory need paths
#	    changed:
#			updatedoc, suhelp, suname and sufind
#	    Then you must run updatedoc to update the help facilities.
#	    It's a good idea to run updatedoc nightly via crontab if
#           your site is actively adding to SU.
#
#           After installation, the makefiles need to scrutinized
#           for incorrect paths so they can be used to install later
#           fixes and enhancements.

######### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ########
#
#   General note: Many files at CWP have been maintained under RCS.
#           Hence they will often be read-only.  When such files
#           have to edited during the installation, the simplest
#           expedient is to give yourself write privileges by
#           "chmod u+w filename."  The RCS directories were omitted
#	    from this tape to save room (4 Mb!).
#
#   Read and change according to the instructions found in:
#		./su/include/suport.h
#
#    To install SU, adjust ROOT, OPTC as indicated above and run
#	"make -f mk.su install"
#    to compile and install the executables.
#
# Note: the compilation of atopkge.c in ./lib will cause some compilers
#       to give warning messages.  This is due to comparison of constants
#       (which, however, are NOT constant across machines).
#
