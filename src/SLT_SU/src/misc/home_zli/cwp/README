All cwp C software depends on .../cwp/lib
Most cwp C software also depends on .../par/lib
BOTH of these are in the compressed tar, cwp.tar.Z, available by anon ftp
and the instructions in the file mk.cwp will guide the installation of BOTH.

CWP software that depends on graphics (eg. SU and almost everything else)
also need plot.tar.Z and xcwp.tar.Z (these will eventually be combined).
The file plot.tar.Z contains both xlib-based and PostScript-based graphics.
The file xcwp.tar.Z contains X graphics that uses the ToolKit.
The respective files mk.plot and mk.xcwp guide the installation of the
graphical software.

The installation of SU requires all the above layers and its installation
is guided by he file mk.su.  The old SU had its own internal graphics (cplot)
and some mains built on SEP's vplot (vplot.cwp).  These are deemed obsolete
here, but are available by request.
