This directory contains x graphics that use the ToolKit.
For now this is only xgraph, but eventually we may re-write
ximage, xwigb, ... to use the ToolKit and get the advantage
of resource files, etc.

The directory also contains FFTLAB, a pedagogical tool
to illustrate discrete Fourier transforms.  But FFTLAB
uses Motif, as well as the ToolKit.
