"\n"
"sudmotx <stdin >stdout cdpmin= cdpmax= dxcdp= noffmix= [optional parms]\n"
"\n"
"Required Parameters:\n"
"cdpmin                  minimum cdp (integer number) for which to apply DMO\n"
"cdpmax                  maximum cdp (integer number) for which to apply DMO\n"
"dxcdp                   distance between successive cdps\n"
"noffmix                 number of offsets to mix (see notes)\n"
"\n"
"Optional Parameters:\n"
"offmax=3000.0           maximum offset\n"
"tmute=2.0               mute time at maximum offset offmax\n"
"vrms=1500.0             RMS velocity at mute time tmute\n"
"verbose=0               =1 for diagnostic print\n"
"\n"
"Notes:\n"
"Input traces should be sorted into common-offset gathers.  One common-\n"
"offset gather ends and another begins when the offset field of the trace\n"
"headers changes.\n"
"\n"
"The cdp field of the input trace headers must be the cdp bin NUMBER, NOT\n"
"the cdp location expressed in units of meters or feet.\n"
"\n"
"The number of offsets to mix (noffmix) should typically equal the ratio of\n"
"the shotpoint spacing to the cdp spacing.  This choice ensures that every\n"
"cdp will be represented in each offset mix.  Traces in each mix will\n"
"contribute through DMO to other traces in adjacent cdps within that mix.\n"
"\n"
"The defaults for offmax and vrms are appropriate only for metric units.\n"
"If distances are measured in feet, then these parameters should be\n"
"specified explicitly.\n"
"\n"
"offmax, tmute, and vrms need not be specified precisely.\n"
"If these values are unknown, then one should overestimate offmax\n"
"and underestimate tmute and vrms.\n"
"\n"
"No muting is actually performed.  The tmute parameter is used only to\n"
"determine parameters required to perform DMO.\n"
"\n"
"Trace header fields accessed:  nt, dt, delrt, offset, cdp.\n"
"\n";
