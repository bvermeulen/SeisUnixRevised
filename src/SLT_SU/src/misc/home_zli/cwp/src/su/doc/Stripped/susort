SUSORT - sort on any segy header keywords
susort <stdin >stdout [[+-]key1 [+-]key2 ...]
Susort supports any number of (secondary) keys with either
ascending (+, the default) or descending (-) directions for
each.  The default sort key is cdp.
Note:	Only the following types of input/output are supported
	Disk input --> any output
	Tape input --> Disk output
	Pipe input --> Disk output
Caveat: In the case of Pipe input a temporary file is made
	to hold the ENTIRE data set.  This temporary is
	either an actual disk file (usually in /tmp) or in some
	implementations, a memory buffer.  It is left to the
	user to be SENSIBLE about how big a file to pipe into
	susort relative to the user's computer.
Example:
To sort traces by cdp gather and within each gather
by offset with both sorts in ascending order:
	susort <INDATA >OUTDATA cdp offset
