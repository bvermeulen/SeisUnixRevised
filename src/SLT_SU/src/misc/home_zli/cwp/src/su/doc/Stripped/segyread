SEGYREAD - read an SEG-Y tape
segyread >stdout [tape=RMTDEVICE]
Required parameters:
	none
Optional parameters:
	tape=RMTDEVICE	tape device to use, see suport.h
	verbose=0	silent operation
	hfile=header	file to store ebcdic block (as ascii)
	bfile=binary	file to store binary block
	over=0		quit if bhed.format not equal 1
	trmin=1		first trace to read
	trmax=LONG_MAX	last trace to read
Note: If you have a tape with multiple sequences of binary
	header, ebcdic header, traces, use the RMTDEVICE that
	invokes the no-rewind option and issue multiple segyread
	commands (making an appropriate shell script if you
	want to save all the headers).  Consider using >> if
	you want a single trace file in the end.  Similar
	considerations apply for multiple reels of tapes,
	but use the standard rewind on end of file.
