"\n"
"sudmofk <stdin >stdout cdpmin= cdpmax= dxcdp= noffmix= [optional parms]\n"
"\n"
"Required Parameters:\n"
"cdpmin                  minimum cdp (integer number) for which to apply DMO\n"
"cdpmax                  maximum cdp (integer number) for which to apply DMO\n"
"dxcdp                   distance between successive cdps\n"
"noffmix                 number of offsets to mix (see notes)\n"
"\n"
"Optional Parameters:\n"
"vmin=1500.0             minimum velocity used to determine maximum slope\n"
"tdmo=0.0                times corresponding to rms velocities in vdmo\n"
"vdmo=vmin               rms velocities corresponding to times in tdmo\n"
"verbose=0               =1 for diagnostic print\n"
"\n"
"Notes:\n"
"Input traces should be sorted into common-offset gathers.  One common-\n"
"offset gather ends and another begins when the offset field of the trace\n"
"headers changes.\n"
"\n"
"The cdp field of the input trace headers must be the cdp bin NUMBER, NOT\n"
"the cdp location expressed in units of meters or feet.\n"
"\n"
"The number of offsets to mix (noffmix) should typically equal the ratio of\n"
"the shotpoint spacing to the cdp spacing.  This choice ensures that every\n"
"cdp will be represented in each offset mix.  Traces in each mix will\n"
"contribute through DMO to other traces in adjacent cdps within that mix.\n"
"\n"
"The tdmo and vdmo arrays specify a velocity function of time that is\n"
"used to implement a first-order correction for depth-variable velocity.\n"
"The times in tdmo must be monotonically increasing.\n"
"\n"
"For each offset, the minimum time at which a non-zero sample exists is\n"
"used to determine a mute time.  Output samples for times earlier than this\n" 
"mute time will be zeroed.  Computation time may be significantly reduced\n"
"if the input traces are zeroed (muted) for early times at large offsets.\n"
"\n"
"Trace header fields accessed:  nt, dt, delrt, offset, cdp.\n"
"\n";
