SUPOW - compute sum of squares on evenly spaced rectangular grid
supow <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]
Required parameters:
	none
Optional parameters:
	outpar=/dev/tty		output parameter file, contains:
				number of geophones (n1=)
				number of shotpoints (n2=)
	ds=1		shot spacing
	dg=1		geophone spacing
	big=0		abort if ds and dg are such that the
			number of grid points exceeds a certain
			multiple of the number of traces in the
	verbose=1	echo information to stderr, verbose = 0
			to unset
Note:
	The output is computed on a rectangular grid ordered by
	shotpoint (sx) and then by geophone location (gx) within sx.
	The grid boundaries are defined by the smallest and largest sx
	and gx in the original data.  The density is defined by ds and
	dg.  Points not corresponding to an (sx, gx) pair in the
	original data are assigned zero power.
	Typical use:
 		supow <stdin >stdout ds=200 dg=50 outpar=parfile
