SUFRAC -- take general (fractional) time derivative
	    or integral of data.  Input is TIME DOMAIN data.
sufrac power= [optional parameters] <indata >outdata
Required parameters:
	power=		exponent of (-i*omega)
			=0  ==> costly do-nothing
			>0  ==> differentiation
			<0  ==> integration
	if dt is not set in header, then dt is mandatory
Optional parameters:
	sign=-1			sign in front of i * omega
	dt = (from header)	time sample rate (in seconds)
The filter is applied in frequency domain.
