SUFFT - fft real time traces to complex frequency traces
suftt <stdin >sdout sign=1
Required parameters:
	none
Optional parameters:
	sign=1			sign in exponent of fft
	dt=from header		sampling interval
Trace header fields accessed: ns, dt, trid
Trace header fields modified: ns, dt, trid
Notes: To facilitate further processing, the sampling interval
      in frequency and first frequency (0) are set in the
	output header.
	sufft | suifft is not quite a no-op since the trace
	length will usually be longer due to fft padding.
