SUMAX - get trace by trace absolute maxima and global maximum magnitude
	and their indices
sumax <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]
Required parameters:
	none
Optional parameters:
	output=ascii
	      =binary	(for binary floats)
	verbose=0 (applies only to the output=ascii option)
		Under the ascii option, verbose=1, prints the trace
		number and maximum value on each trace.	 In addition,
		a message is printed giving the global maximum and its
		location.  With the default, verbose=0, only the global
		maximum is printed.
		Under the binary option, the max on each trace is
		written as a float.
NOTE: Under the verbose option, the sample locations are reported
      zero-based (i.e. first sample is sample 0).
