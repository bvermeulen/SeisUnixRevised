SUWIND - window and time gate traces
suwind <stdin >stdout [options]
Required Parameters:
	none
Optional Parameters:
	verbose = 0	=1 for verbose
...Options for horizontal windowing (trace selection):
	key = tracl	Key header word to window on (see segy.h)
	min = LONG_MIN	min value of key header word to pass
	max = LONG_MAX	max value of key header word to pass
	abs = 0		=1 to take absolute value of
			key header word
	j = 1		Pass every j-th trace ...
	s = 0		... based at s  (if ((key - s)%j) == 0)
	count = ULONG_MAX	... up to count traces
	bad = none	Delete traces with specified bad key
			values
...Options for vertical windowing (time gating):
	tmin = 0.0	min time to pass
	tmax = (from header)	max time to pass
	itmin = 0	min time sample to pass
	itmax =	(from header)  max time sample to pass
	nt = itmax-itmin+1	number of time samples to pass
       				(nt=itmax-itmin+1)
Note: selecting times beyond the maximum in the data induces
      zero padding (up to SU_NFLTS).
	On most 32 bit machines, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX and ULONG_MAX are
	about -2E9,+2E9 and 4E9 and are defined in general in limits.h
