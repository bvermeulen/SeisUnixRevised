"SUNMO - NMO for an arbitrary velocity function of time and CDP\n"

"sunmo <stdin >stdout [optional parameters]\n"
"\n"
"Optional Parameters:\n"
"vnmo=2000               NMO velocities corresponding to times in tnmo\n"
"tnmo=0                  NMO times corresponding to velocities in vnmo\n"
"cdp=0                   CDPs for which vnmo and tnmo are specified\n"
"smute=1.5               samples with NMO stretch exceeding smute are zeroed\n"
"lmute=25                length (in samples) of linear ramp for stretch mute\n"
"sscale=1                =1 to divide output samples by NMO stretch factor\n"
"invert=0                =1 to perform (approximate) inverse NMO\n"
"\n"
"Notes:\n"
"For constant-velocity NMO, specify only one vnmo=constant.\n"
"\n"
"For NMO with a velocity function of time only, specify the arrays\n"
"         vnmo=v1,v2,... tnmo=t1,t2,...\n"
"where v1 is the velocity at time t1, v2 is the velocity at time t2, ...\n"
"The times specified in the tnmo array must be monotonically increasing.\n"
"Linear interpolation and constant extrapolation of the specified velocities\n"
"is used to compute the velocities at times not specified.\n"
"\n"
"For NMO with a velocity function of time and CDP, specify the array\n"
"         cdp=cdp1,cdp2,...\n"
"and, for each CDP specified, specify the vnmo and tnmo arrays as described\n"
"above.  The first (vnmo,tnmo) pair corresponds to the first cdp, and so on.\n"
"Linear interpolation and constant extrapolation of 1/velocity^2 is used\n"
"to compute velocities at CDPs not specified.\n"
"\n"
"NMO interpolation error is less than 1% for frequencies less than 60% of\n"
"the Nyquist frequency.\n"
"\n"
"Exact inverse NMO is impossible, particularly for early times at large\n"
"offsets and for frequencies near Nyquist with large interpolation errors.\n"
"\n"
"Trace header fields accessed:  ns, dt, delrt, offset, cdp.\n"
"\n";
