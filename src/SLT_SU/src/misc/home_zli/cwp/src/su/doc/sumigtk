"Required Parameters:\n"
"dxcdp                   distance between successive cdps\n"
"\n"
"Optional Parameters:\n"
"fmax=Nyquist            maximum frequency\n"
"tmig=0.0                times corresponding to interval velocities in vmig\n"
"vmig=1500.0             interval velocities corresponding to times in tmig\n"
"vfile=                  binary (non-ascii) file containing velocities v(t)\n"
"nxpad=0                 number of cdps to pad with zeros before FFT\n"
"ltaper=0                length of linear taper for left and right edges\n" 
"verbose=0               =1 for diagnostic print\n"
"\n"
"Notes:\n"
"Input traces must be sorted by either increasing or decreasing cdp.\n"
"\n"
"The tmig and vmig arrays specify an interval velocity function of time.\n"
"Linear interpolation and constant extrapolation is used to determine\n"
"interval velocities at times not specified.  Values specified in tmig\n"
"must increase monotonically.\n"
"\n"
"Alternatively, interval velocities may be stored in a binary file\n"
"containing one velocity for every time sample.  If vfile is specified,\n"
"then the tmig and vmig arrays are ignored.\n"
"\n"
"The time of first sample is assumed to be zero, regardless of the value\n"
"of the trace header field delrt.\n"
"\n"
"Trace header fields accessed:  ns and dt\n"
