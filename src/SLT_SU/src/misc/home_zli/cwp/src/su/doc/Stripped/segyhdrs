SEGYHDRS - make SEG-Y ascii and binary headers for segywrite
segyhdrs ns= [bfile= hfile=]
Required parameter:
	ns=the number of samples per trace
Optional parameters:
	bfile=binary	name of file containing binary block
	hfile=header	name of file containing ascii block
The hns and format fields in the binary header are set.  The
other fields are zeroed out.  The header file is created as
ascii and is translated to ebcdic by segywrite before being
written to tape.  Its contents are formal but can be edited
after creation as long as the forty line format is maintained.
Caveat: This program breaks if a \"short\" isn't 2 bytes since
        the SEG-Y standard demands a 2 byte integer for ns.
