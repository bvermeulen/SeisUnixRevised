SUOP2 - do a binary operation on two data sets
suop2 data1 data2 op=diff >stdout
Required parameters:
	none
Optional parameter:
	op=diff		binary operation: sum, prod, quo,
	       		default is diff
Note1: Output = data1 op data2 with the header of data1
Note2: For convenience and backward compatibility, this
	program may be called without an op code as:
	susum  file1 file2 == suop2 file1 file2 op=sum
	sudiff file1 file2 == suop2 file1 file2 op=diff
	suprod file1 file2 == suop2 file1 file2 op=prod
	suquo  file1 file2 == suop2 file1 file2 op=quo
Note3: If an explicit op code is used it must FOLLOW the
	filenames.
Note4: With op=quo, divide by 0 is trapped and 0 is returned.
