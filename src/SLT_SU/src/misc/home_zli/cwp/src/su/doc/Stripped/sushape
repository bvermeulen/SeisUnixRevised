sushape <stdin >stdout  d= [optional parameters]
Required parameters:
	w= vector of input wavelet to be shaped
	d= vector of desired output wavelet
	dt is a mandatory getpar if not set in header
Optional parameters:
     nshape=trace	length of shaping filter
     pnoise=0.001	relative additive noise level
     showshaper=0	=1 to show shaping filter
Trace header fields accessed: ns, dt
Trace header fields modified: none
	To get the shaping filters into an ascii file:
	... | sushape ... showwshaper=1 2>file | ...   (sh or ksh)
	(... | sushape ... showshaper=1 | ...) >&file  (csh)
