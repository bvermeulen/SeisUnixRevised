SUADDHEAD - put headers on bare traces and set the tracl and ns fields
suaddhead <stdin >stdout ns= ftn=0
Required parameter:
	ns=the number of samples per trace
Optional parameter:
	ftn=0		Fortran flag
			0 = data written unformatted from C
			1 = data written unformatted from Fortran
Trace header fields set: ns, tracl
Use sushw/suchw to set other needed fields.
Caution: An incorrect ns field will munge subsequent processing.
Note:    n1 and nt are acceptable aliases for ns.
Example:
suaddhead ns=1024 <bare_traces | sushw key=dt a=4000 >segy_traces
This command line adds headers with ns=1024 samples.  The second part
of the pipe sets the trace header field dt to 4 ms.
