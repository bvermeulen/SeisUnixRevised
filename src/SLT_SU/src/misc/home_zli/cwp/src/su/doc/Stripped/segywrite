SEGYWRITE - write an SEG-Y tape
segywrite <stdin [tape=RMTDEVICE]
Required parameters:
	none
Optional parameter:
	verbose=0	silent operation
	tape=RMTDEVICE	tape device to use, see suport.h
	hfile=header	ebcdic card image header file
	bfile=binary	binary header file
	trmin=1	first trace to write
	trmax=LONG_MAX	last trace to write
Note: The header files may be created with the segyhdrs code.
Caveat: This program breaks if a \"short\" isn't 2 bytes or
        a \"long\" isn't 4 bytes since the the SEG-Y standard
        demands this, but C doesn't impose these sizes.
