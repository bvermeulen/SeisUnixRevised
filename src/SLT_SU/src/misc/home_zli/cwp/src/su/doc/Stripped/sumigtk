SUMIGTK - MIGration via T-K domain method for common-midpoint stacked data
sumigtk <stdin >stdout dxcdp= [optional parms]
Required Parameters:
dxcdp                   distance between successive cdps
Optional Parameters:
fmax=Nyquist            maximum frequency
tmig=0.0                times corresponding to interval velocities in vmig
vmig=1500.0             interval velocities corresponding to times in tmig
vfile=                  binary (non-ascii) file containing velocities v(t)
nxpad=0                 number of cdps to pad with zeros before FFT
ltaper=0                length of linear taper for left and right edges 
verbose=0               =1 for diagnostic print
Notes:
Input traces must be sorted by either increasing or decreasing cdp.
The tmig and vmig arrays specify an interval velocity function of time.
Linear interpolation and constant extrapolation is used to determine
interval velocities at times not specified.  Values specified in tmig
must increase monotonically.
Alternatively, interval velocities may be stored in a binary file
containing one velocity for every time sample.  If vfile is specified,
then the tmig and vmig arrays are ignored.
The time of first sample is assumed to be zero, regardless of the value
of the trace header field delrt.
Trace header fields accessed:  ns and dt
