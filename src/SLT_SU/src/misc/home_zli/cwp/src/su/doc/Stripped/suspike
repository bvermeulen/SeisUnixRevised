SUSPIKE - make a small spike data set
suspike [optional parameters] > out_data_file
Creates a common offset su data file with up to four spikes
for impulse response studies
Optional parameters:
	nt=64 		number of time samples
	ntr=32		number of traces
 	dt=0.004 	time sample rate in seconds
 	offset=400 	offset
	nspk=4		number of spikes
	ix1= ntr/4	trace number (from left) for spike #1
	it1= nt/4 	time sample to spike #1
	ix2 = ntr/4	trace for spike #2
	it2 = 3*nt/4 	time for spike #2
