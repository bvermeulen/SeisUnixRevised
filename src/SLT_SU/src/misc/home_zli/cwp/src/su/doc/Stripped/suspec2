SUSPEC2 - 2-d Fourier SPECtrum of data set
suspec2 <infile >outfile [optional parameters]
Required Parameters:
none
Optional parameter:
	dt=from header		time sampling interval
	dx=1.0			spatial sampling interval
Notes:
	The optional sampling intervals are not needed for
	this program, however they may well be needed for
	subsequent processing (eg. plotting with correct
	scales).
	To facilitate further processing, if dt is set then the
	sampling intervals in f-K are echoed to stderr.
	Note: the relation: w = 2 pi F is well known, but there
	doesn't	seem to be a commonly used letter corresponding
	to F for the spatial conjugate transform variable.  We
	use K for this.  More specifically we assume a phase:
		i(w t - k x) = 2 pi i(F t - K x).
	and echo F (Hz) and K (cycles per trace) to stderr.
