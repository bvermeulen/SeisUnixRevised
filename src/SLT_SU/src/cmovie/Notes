Things to be considered for future work:

   - rounding error in calculation of reference line position

   - kill children at exit?

   - +6 offset in colormap entries.  Why?  does this need to be 
     corrected?

   - larger colortable

   - elimination of multiple redraws.  Is this a cost effective use of
     resources?

   - additional output formats.  Are any really needed?

   - saving parameters.  Are changes required?

   - transposition of the side view axis

   - display correct velocity w/ mouse button 3 (is this fixed?)

   - histogram overlay on colorbar

   - additional cleanup/comments in source code

   - vmerge needs to accept velocity grid and prestack data since
     there is no easy way to replicate velocities for the offset 
     traces
