This is an extensively modified version of Rick Ottelini's program,
rickmovie.  Many latent bugs have been fixed and the ability to 
do velocity overlays in color added.

Unfortunately, at the moment it is dependent on the default X 
visual being 8 bit which is typically not the case now.  As a result
it won't work in many environments.

Hopefully someone will volunteer to fix the problems.
