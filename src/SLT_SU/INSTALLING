   The Makefile system requires Gnu make(1). If you do not have it
   installed in your path you will need to either modify your PATH
   variable or download and compile it. Many elaborate (and in my
   view horrible, e.g. imake(1) ) systems have been created over the
   years to modify Makefiles to deal with different implementations
   of make(1). It's much simpler to just install Gnu make(1) and be
   done.  Most Linux systems will have Gnu make installed.  Solaris,
   FreeBSD & OpenBSD will probably have it somewhere, but you'll need
   to look for it

   You'll also need C & FORTRAN compilers.  gcc & g77 will do nicely,
   though you'll probably get better performance from a commercial 
   compiler if you have one available.  Sun offers both Solaris 10
   and Sun Suite 11, the full development tool set for free download
   for both SPARC and X86 so you might want to consider that option.

   You will need to set the variable SLTROOT to point to the directory
   containing this file.

   for sh, ksh, bash, etc:

      SLTROOT=`pwd`
      export SLTROOT

   for csh, tcsh, etc:
  
      setenv SLTROOT `pwd`


   then:

      cd src

      ./chk_arch

   chk_arch will look to see if Config/Makefile.config.$(ARCH)
   exists. If it does you're all set. If not, you'll need to create
   a file with the name indicated by chk_arch. This is pretty
   simple. The files are short and you can get good hints of where
   to look for things from the files that are included in the Config
   directory. Copy the one which seems the best fit, modify it and
   you're set. 
  
   The most likely changes will be setting the IPATH & LPATH to include
   the X11 & Motif.

   If you create a new Makefile.config.${ARCH} file, please send a
   copy to John Stockwell <jstockwe@mines.edu> so he can include
   it with the next release.

   To start the compile:

   for csh, tcsh, etc:

      make |& tee make.log

   for sh, ksh, bash, etc:

      make 2>1 | tee make.log

   All the make and compiler messages will be copied both to the
   screen and to make.log. After it finishes, search make.log for
   the string "error". If you find it, you'll have to try to sort
   out why and fix it. Once you have a clean build you can install
   the software.  

   If you get error messages about not being able to find a library,
   or header file use find(1) to locate it.
 
   e.g.

      find / -name 'libXt.*'

   or

      find / -name 'Xt.h'


   The binary package of programs, libraries and headers will be
   installed in ${SLTROOT}/${ARCH}:

   for csh, tcsh, etc:

      make install |& tee -a make.log

   for sh, ksh, bash, etc:

      make install 2>1 | tee -a make.log


   You will then need to modify your shell environment to set the
   environment variable, SLTROOT and to add ${SLTROOT}/${ARCH}/bin to
   your PATH.

   To interoperate w/ CWP/SU, you must select the UNOCAL options in
   Makefile.config which define the layout of the unassigned section
   of the SEG-Y trace header and which include the SEG-Y text and 
   binary line headers in the SU format trace file.


   If you run into trouble post a brief description of the problem to
   the seisunix@dix.mines.edu mailing list.  Make sure you include the
   following information:

      - what type of system you are using
      - the ARCH name indicated by chk_arch
      - the section of the make.log showing the error
