README_FIRST:  					23 Dec 2005

The CWP Free Codes are intended to be
an "instant seismic research environment" and, in fact,
represent a large part of our day-to-day working environment at 
the Center for Wave Phenomena.

***Please read the file LEGAL_STATEMENT to see information about
   restrictions and requirments for using the package****

To set up this environment you will need to install
this one item:

cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z --- contains the entire package

xx - denotes current release number.

If you are installing the code on an IBM RS6000 workstation,
a NeXT, SUN (running Solaris), Silicon Graphics,
or a PC running LINUX or an SCO UNIX.
you should have little difficulty in installing the codes. 

However, if you are installing on a machine with
a non-ANSI C compiler, you _will_ have problems installing the codes.
In particular, function prototypes are used throughout the code,
so you must use a C compiler that supports this (great) feature.

Your best bet is to install the  gcc compiler made by GNU software.
This is a free software package available via anonymous ftp 
from: prep.ai.mit.edu
(You will also need to use the glibc library package that is also
available from the same site.)

Another issue that may prevent the immediate installation of the
codes is that some versions of 'make' that are standard on some
systems (Alliant, Convex, FreeBSD, Dec Alpha, for example)
do not support the $$(@F) target flag that we use in our Makefiles.
However, an easy fix has been made so that you can install your
codes using the GNU make, also available at prep.ai.mit.edu.
This fix permits you to install using GNU make by making changes
only in the configuration  file  "Makefile.config".

On Linux systems, "make" is really "GNU make", so if you attempt
to install on these systems, follow the GNU make instructions. 
If you get the error message complaining about "$(@F) not being 
found" on any system, it is likely that GNU make has already
been installed on your system, and you don't know it.
In all of these cases, you need to follow the instructions in
Portability/README_GNU_MAKE.

For instructions on installing the codes, please read README_TO_INSTALL.
Note: there are always changes in the package between releases, so
read this file even if you think you have "been here before".
