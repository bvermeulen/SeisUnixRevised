   This is intended as an example of how to setup geometry headers.
   It cannot be expected to be a general solution. This script
   reads a Shell Processing Support format position file and
   creates a table with the geometry needed to setup the trace
   headers using sushw.

   The script, sps_proc, was based on a single example of an SPS file
   which has been included in expurgated form as a test case.

   In addition, the script depends upon the details of the trace
   header fields that were used to record the shot and channel
   information. This is quite unlikely to match another dataset, so
   prospective users will need to study their dataset and the
   script to work out what changes are needed.

   Before asking me for help with your problems, make sure you have
   done the following:

      read this file carefully

      read the SPS technical standard document at http://seg.org

      read the script

      identified the shot and channel header fields in your data

      have thought about your problem carefully enough to ask an
      answerable question

   This last is most important. Just complaining, "It doesn't work,
   help me!" is NOT an answerable question.

   Answerable questions begin by providing a recitation of what
   you've done to resolve the problem yourself, what you've learned
   and include any information that might be relevant such as what
   software version you're using, operating system, etc.

   I wrote this on a Sun Ultra 20 running Solaris 10. On that
   platform, the version of awk described in "The Awk Programming
   Language" by Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger is called /bin/nawk.
   On most other systems the corresponding version of awk is either
   /bin/awk or /bin/gawk. Complaining that you can't find /bin/nawk
   on your system will guarantee that I will ignore you.

   The outline of the process of setting up your line geometry is as
   follows:

      dump all the non-zero headers from the seismic line into a table
      using the "output=geom" option of sugethw

      search through the table until you locate the headers w/ the shot
      and channel information

      rearrange the table to put the shot number in column 3 and the
      receiver channel in column 4 (or modify sps_proc to read SP & RC
      from the correct columns)


      run sps_proc

        "./sps_proc sps.txt hdr.txt >geom.txt"

   
      plot the columns in geom.txt to verify they make sense

      convert geom.txt to a binary file w/ a2b and write into the 
      headers w/ sushw


   Good luck and Have Fun!
