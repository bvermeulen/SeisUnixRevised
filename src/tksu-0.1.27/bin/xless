 XLESS -- browse text file with LESS in Xterm window

 Usage:  xless textfile [window-title]

 The textfile should contain ascii text.  An xterm window appears with the
 less browser running in F (append) mode.  The display scrolls as text is
 received.  To exit F-mode, hit Ctrl-C; vi-style commands can then be used
 to browse the file contents.
