 4/22/02	Drag-delete link:  if first or last segment of link is
 		grabbed and dragged, allow link to be pulled off port
		("unplugged").  Then drag to another port will reconnect.

 4/23/02	More thorough format checks in LoadSpecs.

 5/23/02	Allow value to be typed in dialog for generic-name entry.
 		Create variable name and value together.

 5/23/02	Consider allowing parameter name to be typed into name
 		entry in parameter dialog, to select parameter by name.
		Incremental search on typed name.  Typing `=' in name entry
		advances focus to value entry.
