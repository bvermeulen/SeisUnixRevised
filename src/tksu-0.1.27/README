Tksu is a graphical front end to the SU seismic processing package.  Tksu
provides an index of modules, dialogs for setting module parameters, online
help, and the ability to build a processing flow by interactively connecting
modules together.  It creates a shell script which may be run immediately or
exported for running later.  Tksu is 100% written in the Tcl/Tk scripting
language, and requires Tcl version 8.0 or higher to run.

Although designed with SU in mind, Tksu is an independent application.  Since
its interface with SU is via a Bourne shell script, any module which follows
the SU command line protocol may be added to the list of modules managed by
tksu.  SU is freely available from the Center for Wave Phenomena, Colorado
School of Mines (www.cwp.mines.edu).

To install tksu:

   1) Change to the installation directory and unpack the tksu package,
      which is in tar-gzip format.  For example,

	cd /usr/local
	tar xzvf ~/tksu-0.1.19.tgz

   2) Change to the new subdirectory and run the INSTALL script.  If an
      argument is given to INSTALL, it names the target directory where tksu
      is to be installed.  With no argument, tksu will be installed in
      /usr/local/bin.  For example,

   	cd tksu-0.1.19
	./INSTALL /usr/local/bin


If the installation fails, try checking the following items:

   1) Verify that the target directory is in your search path:

	echo $PATH | grep /usr/local/bin

   2) Verify that you have permission to install in the target directory:

	ls -ld /usr/local/bin

   3) Verify that Tcl/Tk version 8.0 or later is installed, and that wish8.0
      is in your search path:

   	type -a wish8.0
