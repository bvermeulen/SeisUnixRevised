0.1.26	1 Oct 2002
	Initial beta version uploaded to henrythorson.com.

0.1.27	14 Oct 2002
	Bug fix.  Reported bug: if *.flo script is run with `bash -posix', the
	script fails, reporting that function name is an invalid identifier.
	Fix: in each function name in the script file, replace dashes with
	underscores.  Under POSIX rules, a function name or identifier may
	contain only alphanumeric and underscore characters.
