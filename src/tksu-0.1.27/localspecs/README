  This directory is available to hold spec files for custom and user-
  provided modules.  It is scanned after the ../specs directory, which
  holds the distribution spec files.

  Alternatively, custom spec files may be placed in any of the directories
  named in the TKSU_PATH environment variable (if defined).  These
  directories are automatically scanned by tksu on startup, after ../specs
  and ../localspecs.
