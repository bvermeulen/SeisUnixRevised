The main program is called xor.c and is designed to solve the classic xor
problem.  The header file, neural_float.h, contains all the routines.  To
make sure everything is working try a netsize of 3 layers, 2 nodes in
the first, 5 in the second, and 1 in the last.  The network should converge
to the correct answer in about 20432 iterations.  Feel free to change the 
programs in anyway you wish and to distribute them with SU or via anonymous 
ftp.  I know the programming is a little inefficient.  I ported these
routines from FORTRAN to C primarily to learn C.  If you have any questions 
don't hesitate to let me know.
