 This program updates headers from general csv or fixed format text files.",
 (You cannot use UKOOA streamer-marine R-records as input here).          ",

 This program can update full geometry using the 3 SPS fixed format files.",
 Parameter setting for SPS2 and SPS1 is so complex that this program has  ",
 explicit option names=sps2 and names=sps1 for those files. But the SPS   ",
 files often have numbers that are too large to be stored in some SU keys.",
 Or, the SPS files may be unusable for other reasons. In these cases, you ",
 need to use the SUTOOLCSV program to repair the SPS files or to convert  ",
 those files to comma-separated files for input to SpreadSheet programs   ",
 in order to make other repairs before running this program.              ",

 Refer to the documentation of SUTOOLCSV for SPS files since it has       ",
 extensive explanations and examples.                                     ",


 For SPS2 files, 3 runs of this program are needed. Initially, I suggest  ",
 using create=all option for the X-file. This reads no input traces but   ",
 creates traces as defined by the X-file records (see create= below).     ",

 sugeomcsv rfile=X.txt setid=x create=all >dummy1.su names=sps2 match=sps2",

 sugeomcsv rfile=S.txt setid=s <dummy1.su >dummy2.su names=sps2 match=sps2",

 sugeomcsv rfile=R.txt setid=r <dummy2.su >dummy3.su names=sps2 match=sps2",


 If the SPS2 files have been processed by SUTOOLCSV then these 3 runs     ",
 can be done instead.                                                     ",

 sugeomcsv rfile=X.csv create=all >dummy1.su                              ",
 sugeomcsv rfile=S.csv <dummy1.su >dummy2.su                              ",

 The documentation herein covers simple text files, but mostly concerns   ",
 itself with other aspects of the use of SUGEOMCSV.                       ",

 In other words, the documentation for SUGEOMCSV is complex enough that   ",
 I do not want to repeat all the documentation contained in SUTOOLCSV.    ",


 -------------                                                            ",

 Consider a comma separated text file with 3 values per record.           ",
 The 3 values are: record id, energy source number, and elevation.        ",

       S,11,343                                                           ",
       S,42,342                                                           ",
       S,25,340                                                           ",
       C,some comment,                                                    ",
       S,45,347                                                           ",

  To update shot elevation to trace headers requires this:                ",

  sugeomcsv <intraces >outtraces rfile=values3.csv setid=S match=es       ",
            names=C_su_id,es,selev                                        ",

  setid=S says only read values from text records that start with S.      ",
  match=es says get the value of es from input trace header.              ",
 names=C_su_id,es,selev assigns names to the 3 values in the_text_file    ",
 Other details for the above parameters will be discussed later.          ",

 So, the value of es is gotten from input trace, then the text record     ",
 with same es value is found, and the selev is updated to output trace.   ",
 Note that every trace with the same es value is updated with same selev. ",
   You can use multiple matches to find text records (match=sx,sy).       ",
 If the text records contain a fourth value with depth then you can       ",
 update it at the same time using (names=C_su_id,es,selev,sdepth).        ",
 If you want to update just sdepth then (names=C_su_id,es,null,sdepth)    ",

 Note that trace input order does not matter. Neither does text record    ",
 order. The text file is read and all non-null and non-numb name values   ",
 are stored and sorted by match=. But there is no interpolation, so the   ",
 match= numbers must be found in text records (within a small tolerance). ",

 Now consider the same 3 values but in a fixed format text file:          ",

       S       11  343                                                    ",
       S       42  342                                                    ",
       S       25  340                                                    ",
       C  some comment                                                    ",
       S       45  347                                                    ",

  To update shot elevation to trace headers requires this:                ",

  sugeomcsv <intraces >outtraces rfile=values3.txt setid=S match=es       ",
            names=C_su_id,2_es_10,11_selev_15                             ",

  The first difference is that the rfile now has .txt rather than .csv    ",
  The other difference is in names=C_su_id,2_es_10,11_selev_15 where      ",
  both es and selev have leading and trailing numbers indicating the      ",
  character range that they occupy in the fixed format records of rfile.  ",
  Note that C_su_id does not have the leading and trailing numbers since  ",
  it is special in several ways (detailed later).                         ",

  When parsing fixed format files it is not actually needed to specify    ", 
  fields that you decide to null. But it is easier to make changes in     ", 
  the future if you retain all known fields in the names= lists. This is  ", 
  why SUTOOLCSV produces C_SU records that contain all officially defined ", 
  fields for SPS2 and SPS1 formats (even though it nulls some names).     ", 

  --------------                                                          ",

  Alternately, instead of putting parameters on the command line,         ",
  you can add similar parameter records into the rfile.                   ",
  Details follow later, but here is an example:                           ",

  the same rfile as the values records. And match= setid= names= are      ",

  command line). If they are specified on the command line and also exist ",
  in the rfile, their command line options override rfile.                ",

  Note that commas are still specified in the C_SU_ parameter records     ",

  Notice that the C_SU_NAMES are allowed to have leading and trailing     ",
  integers even though the data records have commas. When rtype=csv they  ",
  are ignored in this program (but you should retain leading and trailing ",
  numbers because SUTOOLCSV uses them to convert csv back to fixed files).",

  Notice also that C_SU_MATCH and C_SU_SETID have extra commas. This may  ",
  occur for comma-separated files output by SpreadSheet programs. These   ",
  extra commas are also permitted for C_SU_MATCH and C_SU_SETID records   ",
  in fixed format files. (The C_SU_MATCH read-in stops at the first null, ",
  all-blank, or sequential commas. And C_SU_SETID only reads first id).   ",

  If you are wondering why the actual names are in the row following      ",
  C_SU_NAMES, consider how this will be output from a SpreadSheet program.",
  (The 3 actual names need to be in the same columns with the data that   ",
  they refer to).                                                         ",

  --------------                                                          ",

  For simple text files, using the command line to specify everything may ",
  be more convenient. But specification for SPS and similar files gets    ",
  quite intricate and is usually better done via C_SU_ parameter records. ",
  For this reason, the SUTOOLCSV program actually outputs the high-level  ",
  SPS2 and SPS1 options in expanded version into its output text files.   ",
  This give you the opportunity to see and modify them as needed.         ",

  You can also specify ufile= to read the parameter records from another  ",
  file. This allows you to use the same ufile for different surveys.      ",

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ",

 For full initial geometry this program usually must be run multiple times",
 For instance, if you have 3 SPS files, this program must be run 3 times. ",
 The SPS X-file must be used in first run, then S then R (or R then S).   ", 
 
 The first run of this program inputs the SPS X-file and then uses the    ", 
 trace header fldr and tracf numbers to find the correct X-record inside  ",
 the X-file. The computed gaps numbers is updated to the output trace     ",
 (gaps is the SU key name I decided to use, it is usually called          ",
 receiver point or receiver number in SPS and other documents).           ",
 Other values from the X-record are also updated (these are usually       ",
 receiver line number and shot line number and shot point number.         ",
 For 3D surveys, in the next 2 runs of SUGEOMCSV:                         ", 
      Two of the values output from the X-file are used                   ", 
      to find the correct records within the S-file.                      ", 
      Two of the values output from the X-file are used                   ", 
      to find the correct records within the R-file.                      ", 
 (For 2D surveys, in the next 2 runs of SUGEOMCSV only 1 value may be     ", 
  needed to find the correct records for S-file and 1 for R-file).        ", 
 
 NOTE: The SPS discussions above assume that fldr contains field record   ", 
       number, and tracf contains channel number. This is not necessarily ", 
       the case. In particular, the channel number might not be in tracf. ", 
       It might be in some other SU key name, or it might not exist       ", 
       at all, in which case you are going to have to figure out how to   ", 
       alter some input trace key name to correspond to the channel       ", 
       ranges on the X-records.                                           ", 

 NOTE: Sometimes SPS X-files deliberately specify receiver line numbers   ", 
       or point ranges that do not exist in the R-files. For instance,    ", 
       with a 10 line by 240 point pattern layout, it is sometimes easier ", 
       for recording instruments to simply pretend that the line numbering", 
       and point numbering continues infinitely. The traces corresponding ", 
       to this are simply allowed to record noise. Othertimes the traces  ", 
       are not recorded at all. For this situaton you need to specify     ", 
       missing=delete or pass (or pre-delete the traces).                 ",

 This program is now almost completely different from SUGEOM,  
 but it did save me much effort getting familiar with SU.
