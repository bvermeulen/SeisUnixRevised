 LOGISTICFIT - least squares fit of a LOGISTIC function to input data 	

  logisticfit <infile >outfile [optional parameters]			

 Required Parameter:							
 n=			the number of values of t and P(t)		
 Optional Parameters:							
 nstart=0		start of input data window			
 nend=n		end of input data window			

 outpar=/dev/tty 	output parameter file				

 Notes:								
 If the data are a population P(t) as a function of time t, then the 	
 input consists of unformatted C-style floats in the form of a vector of
 length 2n consisting of the vector of the values of 			
 [t0,t1,t2,...tn-1)] followed by [P(t0),P(t1),P(t2),...,P(tn-1)].	

 Notes about logistic curve fitting:					
 The logistic function is a nontrivial solution to the Verhulst equation

		 dP/dt = r P(1-P/K)					

 which describes the growth of a population P(t), with growth rate r   
 and carrying capacity K. This equation has analytic solution:		

	       P(t)= K/(1 + (K-P0)/P0 exp(-r(t-t0))			

 Here P0=P(t0). 							

 The goal of this program is, that given population data that is assumed
 to be governed by the logistic equation, to estimate K and r. These   
 may then be used as input to the program 'verhulst'. In that program  
 a1 corresponds to r and a2 corresponds to K here. 			

 Caveat: this code will give results that get you close, but you may   
 have to hand adjust r and K to suit your data.

 Algorithm:

 Part I:
 We note
	dP/dt = r P(1-P/K)
 implies
      dP/dt
    --------- = d/dt ln(P) =  -(r/K) P + r 
       P 
 Hence, plotting d/dt ln(P)  versus  P  will have a linear trend of slope -(r/K) and
 intercept r. Thus, for y = mx + b    K=(-intercept/slope)

 The logarithmic derivative is implemented in this code as (dP/dt)/P
 

 Part II:
 Second we note that the solution is the logistic (sigmoid function) curve given by

     P(t) =		 K
		 -------------------------- 
	       1 + ([K-P0]/P0) exp[-r(t-t0)]

 Here P0 is the value of P(t) at t0

 P(t)( 1 + ([K-P0]/P0) exp[-r(t-t0)] ) = K
       
	     ([K-P0]/P0) exp[-r(t-t0)] = [K-P(t)]/P(t)   
       
	  -r(t-t0) = ln([K-P(t)]/P(t)) +  ln(P0/[K-P0]) = ln([K-P(t)]/P(t)) + C
       
 Given an estimate of K from the Part I, a line through a plot of 
	   ln([K-P(t)]/P(t))  versus time t will have a slope of -r
       
	  r(t-t0) = ln(P(t)/[K-P(t)]) + C
       
 Here the ln() argument is flipped around to remove the minus sign.
