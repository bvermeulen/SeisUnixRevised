SVD - Singular Value Decomposition related routines

compute_svd - perform singular value decomposition 
svd_backsubstitute - back substitute results of compute_svd
svd_sort - sort singular values in descending order

Credits:
The compute_svd routine is adapted from svdecomp.c in XLISP-STAT 2.1 which is
code from Numerical Recipes adapted by Luke Tierney and David Betz.

This is a translation in C from an code written in Fortran that appeared
in NETLIB, EISPACK, and SLATEC collections that was itself a translation
from an original Algol code that appeared in:

Original Algol code that is the basis of svdecomp.c is from:
Golub, G. and C. Reinsch (1971) Handbook for automatic computation II,
 linear algebra, p 134-151. SpringerVerlag, New York.
