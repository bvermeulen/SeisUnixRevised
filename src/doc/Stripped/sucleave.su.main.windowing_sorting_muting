 SUCLEAVE - Cleave traces from 1 input into multiple output files.     ",
           (split to multiple output files, retaining input order).    ",

 sucleave <stdin key=offset low=50 size=100 abs=1                      ",

 key=offset  name of key used to seperate traces to output files.      ",

    abs=1    Use absolute value of key.                                ",
       =0    Do not use absolute value of key.                         ",

  size=100   size of key ranges for output files. Must be > 0.         ",

  low=size/2 Base value in lowest magnitude range for output files.    ",
             The default is size/2. Must be <= size/2 and > 0.         ",
             For each output file the centre of the range of traces    ",
             output to it is low+size*N (where N is an integer).       ",
              ( The lower boundary is included in the N range,         ", 
               but the higher boundary belongs to the N+1 range ).     ", 

 high=100000 base value in highest magnitude range for output files.   ",
             (This value is adjusted to a multiple of low+size*N).     ",
             If abs=1 the range limits are from  low  to high.         ",
             If abs=0 the range limits are from -high to high.         ",

  outbase=   This value is used as part of the output file names.      ",
             By default outbase is cleave_key_ where key is key= name. ",
             The nearest integer of the range base value (low+size*N)  ",
             is always appended after outbase. For example:            ",
               cleave_offset_50.su   cleave_offset_150.su              ",

  print=0    Do not print.                                             ",
       =1    Print filename, trace count, average key value for        ",
             each created output file. Note that ranges with 0 traces  ",
             will make no print.                                       ",

  ATTENTION: No traces are deleted. All traces less than the minimum   ",
             key range are written to one extra file, and all traces   ",
             greater than the maximum key range are written to another ",
             extra file.     WARNINGS are printed if this occurs.      ",
             These extra files can be recognized because the number in ",
             their names is outside the low,high ranges you specified. ",

  NOTES                                                                ",
   1. See simple tests (examples) in src/demos/Utilities/Sucleave      ",
   2. Output files are not created until a trace is written to them.   ",
      So, specifying excessive low= and high= values has little        ",
      consequences except for some small memory allocation herein.     ",
   3. Bad choice of size can create an output file for every trace.    ",

 EXAMPLE USES:                                                         ",
   1. You may want to deliberately partition your traces for different ",
      processing. You can cleave your traces into offset ranges, while ",
      retaining cdp order in those offset-ranged files.                ",
      You can then use subraid to bring them back together.            ",
   2. In streamer-cable-marine you may want to partition your shot     ",
      gathers by cables (or port-starboard shot, cable combinations).  ",
      This is sometimes called nominal subsurface line processing.     ",
      You can then use subraid to bring them back together.            ",
