 SUBRAID - Braid traces from files together and output.                
           (combine multiple ordered inputs into 1 ordered output)     

 subraid in1=filea.su in2=fileb.su in3=...   key=cdp >stdout           

   inMM= An input file name. Where MM is 1 or 2 digits (0 to 99).      
         Therefore 100 files can be input in one setup.                
         Examples: in0= in1= in33= in99=                               
         There must be at least 2 input files.                         

   key=  Keys that indicate the order of the traces in every input.    
         Traces must be in this order. Order is checked on-the-fly     
         and an error-halt will occur if input trace order is wrong.   
         This parameter can be a list. For instance:  key=cdp,offset   
         means the traces are in offset order within cdps.             
         A negative sign in front of the name means decreasing order   
         for the values of that key.                                   
         Note: If the key= values are equal, the traces from the       
               input file with lower MM number are output first.       

  trac=1 Reset tracl and tracr keys to the output trace count          
         (really only done because the SUSORT program resets them).    
      =0 Do not reset. Copy as-is to output.                           

 This program can combine multiple cdp ordered input files into one    
 cdp ordered output file. It can also combine multiple input files     
 of any other order into one output file in same order. This is done   
 by a process conceptually similar to braiding hair or braiding a rope.

 Basically, you tell this program the names of the su keys which       
 indicate the input trace order. This program opens all input files    
 and outputs whichever trace is lowest. It then reads another trace    
 from that input file and again finds lowest trace for all input files.
 It repeats the process until no traces remain on any input file.      
 (For traces with the same key values, the trace from lowest inMM= is  
 is output first. All traces are always output - except on error-halt).

 So, for cdp order, if file1 has 3 traces in cdp 17 and file2 has      
 5 traces in cdp 17, then the output will have 8 traces in cdp 17.     
 It does not matter if a cdp only exists in one file, and it does      
 not matter if there are gaps in cdp numbers in the files.             

 Notes:                                                                
   1. See tests (examples) in src/demos/Utilities/Subraid              
   2. This program only stores 1 trace at a time from each input file. 
   3. Trace order is checked on-the-fly to make sure it matches        
      your key= list. If it does not match, error-halt occurs after    
      output of the last trace which IS in the correct order.          
   4. Only trace order is checked. No other checks at all. You can     
      easily cause bad results by inputting files where the traces have", 
      been procssed differently. Or by processing data in pieces when  
      it should be kept together (surface consistant analysis, etc.).  
   5. For clarify, remember that being in order does not necessarily   
      mean that traces have been through a sort program. This is fine, 
      subraid.c does not care how the su key values got into order.    

 EXAMPLE USES:                                                         
   1. Imagine that your survey is so large you have trouble sorting it 
      to cdp order. Just sort howevermany shot gathers you want into   
      cdp order. Then sort another set of shot gathers into cdp order. 
      Keep doing that until you have sorted all your traces.           
      Then use this program to combine the multiple cdp ordered files  
      into one output file. Note for both 2d and 3d, these cdp sorted  
      input files have over-lapping cdps. Some cdps only exist in      
      one of the input files and some cdps in multiple input files.    
   2. You may want to deliberately partition your traces for different 
      processing. This can be done by sucleave (and other programs).   
      You can cleave your traces into offset ranges, while retaining   
      cdp order in those offset-ranged files. Then use subraid to      
      bring them back together.                                        
   3. In streamer-cable-marine you may want to partition your shot     
      gathers by cables (or port-starboard shot, cable combinations).  
      This is sometimes called nominal subsurface line processing.     
      This program can help put these kinds of data partitions back    
      together while reducing resource utilization.
