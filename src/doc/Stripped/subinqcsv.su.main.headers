 SUBINQCSV - Input Q-records or parameters. interpolate, output Q-records.  

  subinqcsv [parameters].   (No traces in or out).                          

 Parameters:	         						     

 qin=       Input file containing q-records. This parameter is optional,    
            but if you do not specify it, you must specify a set of         
            parameters which you can see lower down in this document.       
            Those parameters allow specification similar to sunmo.          

 qout=      Output file for q-records. Must be specified.                   

 rfile=     If set, read a K-file containing 3D grid definition. Assumed 2D ", 
            if no file is specified here. A 3D forces restrictions on the   ", 
            input locations (they have to form aligned rectangles).         ", 
            A 2D means that parameters for the igi component of 3Ds will be 
            honored, but parameters for the igc component are not allowed.  

 check=0   Do not print checking details. The options of this program       
           cannot repair a corrupt input grid. Grid checking is always      
           done on input grid definition and will error-halt if corrupt.    
      =1   print checking details.                                          

 inloc=1   Location options. The option here determines which input names   
           contain the locations of all other input values. The option here 
           must find the corresponding names within the non-tuple names in  
           the input q-file or in the parameter names you specify (later).  
      =1   cdp (default). Option 1 is required if no grid is input.         
      =2   cdpt (grid transposed cdp numbers).                              
      =3   igi,igc (grid index numbers).                                    
      =4   gx,gy (grid coordinates).                                        
      =5   sx,sy (world coordinates).                                       
           You may want to use iecho=1 initially with these options since   
           the output q-records will contain the cell centre values         
           corresponding to your choice here (giving you a chance to        
           adjust your input values before going through the error-check    
           that forces the input locations to be in aligned rectangles).    

 keyloc=   Location key. Can only be specified if inloc=1 and 2D (no rfile).
           Name must be in the input Q-file (or parameters listed below).   
           This allows linear interpolation based on values such as point   
           numbers, station numbers, reciever numbers, or shot numbers.     
           Parameters extrapi and igiout refer to these values.             

 extrapi=0        do not extrapolate at ends in igi direction.              
                  (values beyond outer functions are held constant).        
               =1 extrapolate beyond outer functions at both ends           
               =2 extrapolate beyond outer functions only at lower end      
               =3 extrapolate beyond outer functions only at higher end     
               For 2D, this parameter controls extrapolation at line ends.  

 extrapc=0        do not extrapolate at ends in igc direction.              
                  (values beyond outer functions are held constant).        
               =1 extrapolate beyond outer functions at both ends           
               =2 extrapolate beyond outer functions only at lower end      
               =3 extrapolate beyond outer functions only at higher end     

 extrapt=0        do not extrapolate at ends in independent values.         
                  (values outside range of functions are held constant).    
               =1 extrapolate outside range of functions                    
               =2 extrapolate when less than range of functions             
               =3 extrapolate when greater than range of functions          

 igiout=1   Output igi range (default is entire igi range of grid).         
            List with one, two, or three integers.                          
       =f     start at f, increment by 1, end at maximum igi of grid.       
       =f,l   start at f, increment by 1, end at l or maximum igi of grid.  
       =f,l,i start at f, increment by i, end at l or nearest igi that      
              is not greater than maximum igi of grid.                      
             For 2D, f and l default to minimum and maximum numbers within  
             the cdp= list or in the q-records input via qin=. For 2D, they 
             are allowed to be set outside that range (you can extrapolate  
             to the true first and last cdp of line).                       

 igcout=1   Output igc range (default is entire igc range of grid).         
            Same options as the previous igiout parameter.                  

 outind=0   Output independent dimension range. One, two, or three numbers. 
            No default, but outlist can be specified instead.               
            Cannot be specified if input has no tuples.                     
       =f,l,i start at f, increment by i, end at last value <= l.           
       =f,l   start at f, increment by 1000, end at last value <= l.        
       =f     start at f, increment by 1000, end at last value <= 3000.     
            The i value cannot be 0, but can be negative, which requires    
            an l value less than or equal to f.                             

 outlist=   Output independent dimension value list. Cannot be specified    
            if outind is used. Cannot be specified if input has no tuples.  

 invp2=v    Square and inverse values before applying bilinear weighting.   
            (This is how velocities are treated in sunmo and sunmocsv).     
            The sequence is: linear interpolate to outind or outlist values,
            square and inverse, perform weighted-sum based on location,     
            then inverse square-root that sum. The default is to do this if 
            the value name starts with v. You can also specify any other    
            characters such as vq, tzm, qtal and so on.                     
       =all use square and inverse for all values.                          
      =none use square and inverse for no values.                           
     =tuple use square and inverse for all values in the tuples.            
  =nontuple use square and inverse for all values not in the tuples.        

 ename=     Names to eliminate. These names will be ignored in the input    
            q-records and therefore not be in the output q-records (note    
            that standard 2d and 3d names will still be output even if you  
            specify them here). A primary purpose of this option is to get  
            rid of names in input tuples in order to reduce the complexity  
            of output q-records (in case certain programs cannot handle it).
            But you can also get rid of non-tuple names here.               

 iecho=0    Full spatial output (do not just output at the input locations).
      =1    Just output at the same locations as input.                     
            This still performs interpolation in the independent dimension  
            as specified by outind or outlist. (This option bypasses the    
            error check that input locations must form aligned rectangles). 
              Parameters igiout= and igcout= cannot be specified.           

 formtv=%.2f The C format code for printing all values in the q-records     
             except the standard names cdp,cdpt,igi,igc.                    
             These names are specially handled within this program.         
             For 3D, they are generated for output using grid definition.   
             For 2D, igi,igc are not output.                                
             The default is 2 digits below the decimal point.               

 formxy=%.2f The C format code for printing gx,gy,sx,sy in the q-records.   
             These names are specially handled within this program.         
             For 3D, they are generated for output using grid definition.   
             For 2D, they are not output.                                   
             The default is 2 digits below the decimal point.               

   ------------------------------------------------------------------       
   ------------------------------------------------------------------       
   The following parameters can only be specified if you                    
   do not specify an input q-file using parameter qin=.                     

 cdp=             The parameters to the left are all optional but at least  
 cdpt=            one of them must be specified. These are the names which  
 fldr=            contain single values at each location (also known as     
 grnors=    	   the non-tuple names). Typically, cdp= is the most likely  
 grnofr=    	   name to specify. Each name specified here must have the   
 grnlof=    	   same amount of values (separated by commas).              
 gaps=      	   For example: cdp=2,7,23,44 means that you must also       
 igi=       	   list 4 values if you specify numa=.                       
 igc=       	                                                             
 gx=                                                                        
 gy=                                                                        
 sx=              Note the names specified must include the names needed    
 sy=              for your inloc= option (by default inloc= requires cdp).  
 numa=                                                                      
 numb=                                                                      
 vuma=            (See invp2= for why some names here start with v).        
 vumb=                                                                      

 tupa=            The parameters to the left are all optional. These are    
 offs=            the names which have multiple values at each location     
 tims=            (also known as the tuple names). Typically, tims= and     
 tnmo=            vnmo= are the most likely names to specify. Each name     
 dpth=      	   specified here must be repeated same number of times as   
 vels=            amount of values in non-tuple names above (except Note 1).
 vnmo=            (See invp2= for why some names here start with v).        
 tupb=    Note 1: Usually, any of the previous parameter names must be      
 vupa=            repeated for each value in the non-tuple lists. But the   
                  independent dimension name can also be specified just one 
                  time if all the other names here have the same amount of  
                  values as that single set of independent dimension values.
          Note 2: The independent dimension defaults to first name that is  
            	   found in order here (NOT their order on the command line).

	Example using 3 cpds with velocity semblance scan picks:             

         cdp=7,27,57                                                        
         tims=500,780,1240,2100,4000                                        
         vels=1500,1930,2260,3100,4400                                      
         tims=400,680,2400,3800                                             
         vels=1300,1730,3700,4300                                           
         tims=400,680,880,1140,2400,3800                                    
         vels=1300,1500,1730,2300,3700,4300                                 

       And, if you have a static value at these 3 cdps, then also:          
         numa=5.30,17.44,12.63                                              

   ------------------------------------------------------------------       

  Notes:                                                       	     

   All input values are stored in double-precision (8 byte float).          

   This program does not care if the values are seconds or milliseconds     
   or feet or metres. To this program they are all just numbers. However,   
   default of parameter invp2= treats names starting with v differently     
   for weighting.                                                           


 For 3D, user needs to input locations which form aligned rectangles.       
 That is, how-ever-many grid inlines the user chooses to put locations on,  
 there must always be the same number of locations on each inline and those 
 functions must be located at the same grid crosslines. For instance, if    
 the user inputs locations for inline 7 at crosslines 15,25,40 then the     
 the user must alos input locations at crosslines 15,25,40 for any other    
 inlines that the user wants to supply locations for. (If user is lucky     
 enough that the grid has 100 inlines, then the input locations could be at 
 CDPs 715,725,740 and 1115,1125,1140 and 2015,2025,2040 and 2515,2525,2540. 
 Note that the inloc= option allows different values to be used to specify  
 locations but they are all translated to inline and crossline numbers      
 of the cell centre using the input 3D grid definition.                     

 Bilinear interpolation is done if the output location is surrounded by 4   
 input locations. If the output location is not surrounded by 4 input       
 locations, the result depends on the extrapi and extrapc options.          
 The result can be any combination of linear interpolation, linear          
 extrapolation, and constant extrapolation. If input locations only exist   
 along 1 inline or 1 crossline the result is linear interpolation in that   ", 
 direction (and linear or constant extrapolation at locations beyond ends).
