 Notes:							
 This program is really just a demo showing how to use the 	
 differential equation solver rke_solve written by Francois 	
 Pinard, based on a modified form of the 4th order Runge-Kutta 
 method, which employs the error checking method of R. England 
 1969.								

 The output consists of unformated C-style binary floats, of	
 either pairs or triplets as specified by the "mode" paramerter.

 About compartmentalized models: The population is assumed to  
 move from being Susceptible, to Infective, and finally to the 
 Removed, who are dead and the recovered.			

 Important quantities:						
 r0 = number of new infections per single infected host	
  1 < r0 < 1.5 for influenza, (2.2 to 2.7 for Covid-19), 12 to 
 18 for measles.						
  b, k, s0, and r0 are related via				
  k = b*s0/r0 = b/r0 when s0/N and s0=N			

 S = number susceptible to the infection			
 E = number of exposed						
 I = number of those capable of passing on the infection	
 R = number removed = dead + recovered				
 Examples:							
 Default:							
 seirpidemic | xgraph n=40 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal &		

 Hypothetical flu in a school models:				
 here there is a 0.3 exposure to infective rate		
 seirepidemic h=0.1 stepmax=100 s=.3 b=.3 k=.9 N=100 mode=SIR |
	xgraph n=100 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal &		

 Hong Kong Flu 1968-1969:					
 https://services.math.duke.edu/education/ccp/materials/diffcalc/sir/sir1.html
 Population is N=s0=7.9 million, r0=1.5, the average period of 	
 infectiveness is  3 days so k=1/3, b=r0*k=(3/2)(1/3)=0.54, and initial
 infected is i0=10. An exposed to infective rate s=1/3 is assumed	

  seirepidemic h=1 stepmax=200 s=.3333 k=.3333 b=.5 N=7.9e6 mode=SIR |	
	xgraph n=200 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal &

 The SRI model describes an epidemic in terms of
   S = susceptibles in a population
   E = exposed in a population
   I = infectives in a population
   R = removed = recovered + dead

   s0 = initial value of the susceptibles
   e0 = initial value of the exposed
   i0 = initial value of the infectives
   r0 = initial removed value = 0
   
   S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N 
   
   S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1  when S, E, and I are normalized by N
   
   r0 = b*s0/k  = basic reproduction rate
   b = rate of exposure
   s = rate of infection of the exposed
   k = rate removal = recovery rate + death rate

   Without vital dynamics.
   The encounters between susceptibles and infectives is represented
   by the product S*I  
	S'(t) = - b*S*I		( newly exposed )
	E'(t) = b*S*I - s*E	( exposed - newly infected )
	I'(t) = s*E - k*I 	( infectives - newly removed )
	R'(t) = k*I 		( removed )	

  Without vital dynamics.
  SIR model (with Baker 2020 reactive social distancing):
   As infective number increases, social distancing increases and the  
   infectivity value b decreases.

      s'(t) =  - b*s(t)*i(t)/(1+gamma*i(t))
      i'(t) = b*s(t)*i(t)/(1+gamma*i(t)) - k*i(t)
      r'(t) = k*i(t)

   With vital dynamics (birth and death rates added).
   The encounters between susceptibles and infectives is represented
   by the product S*I  
	S'(t) = mu - nu*S -  b*S*I  (birth - dead - newly exposed)
	E'(t) = b*S*I - nu*E - s*E  (exposed - dead - newly infected)
	I'(t) = s*E - k*I - nu*I	(infected - newly removed - dead))
	R'(t) = k*I - nu*R		(removed - dead )	

 S(t)= susceptible members (no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration)
 E(t)= Exposed number 
 I(t)= infective number 
 R(t)= removed members = recovered + dead + sequestered

 There is an impiled flow from S(t) -> E(t) -> I(t) -> R(t), though infected
 who are quarantined immediately become part of R(t).

 The product b*S*I denotes the interaction of the infective population with
 the susceptible population..
