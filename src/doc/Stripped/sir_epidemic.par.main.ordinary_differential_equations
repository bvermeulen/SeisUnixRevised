 Notes:							
 This program is really just a demo showing how to use the 	
 differential equation solver rke_solve written by Francois 	
 Pinard, based on a modified form of the 4th order Runge-Kutta 
 method, which employs the error checking method of R. England 
 1969.								

 The output consists of unformated C-style binary floats, of	
 either pairs or triplets as specified by the "mode" paramerter.

 About compartmentalized models: The population is assumed to  
 move from being Susceptible, to Infective, and finally to the 
 Removed, who are dead and the recovered.			

 Important quantities:						
 R0 = number of new infections per single infected host  	
  1 < R0 < 1.5 for influenza, (2.2 to 2.7 for Covid-19), 12 to	
 18 for measles.						
  b, k, s0, and R0 are related via				
  k = b*s0/R0 = b/R0 when  s0=s0/N and s0=N 			

  It is often easier to determine the recovery rate k (in units
  of h and to determine reasonable estimate of s0 and of R0 	
  and to calculate the infection rate b = k*R0/s0 or b=k*R0	
  when s0=N and is normalized by N.				

 S = total number susceptible to the infection			
 I = total number of those capable of passing on the infection	
 R = total number removed = dead + recovered			

 When xi is nonzero, then there is a potential that fraction of", 
 the removed population can be reinfected.			

 Examples:							
 Default:							
 sir_epidemic | xgraph n=40 nplot=3 d1=1 style=normal &	

 Influenza in an English boarding school, 1978:		
 s0=N=762 i0=1,  2 students infected per day, 1/2 of the infected	
 population removed per day. Take b=2 k=0.5 			

 Normalized by N:						
 sir_epidemic h=0.1 stepmax=200 i0=1 b=2 k=.5 N=762 mode=SIR |	
  xgraph n=200 nplot=3 d1=.1 style=normal label1="days"  &	

 Normalized by N, output scaled by N:				
 sir_epidemic h=0.1 stepmax=200 i0=1 b=2 k=.5 N=762 mode=SIR scale=1 |
  xgraph n=200 nplot=3 d1=.1 style=normal label1="days" &	

 Kong Flu 1968-1969:						
 https://services.math.duke.edu/education/ccp/materials/diffcalc/sir/sir1.html
 Population is N=s0=7.9 million, R0=1.5, the average period of	
 infectiveness is  3 days so k=1/3, b=R0*k=(3/2)(1/3)=0.5, and initial
 infected is i0=10.						

  Normalized by N						
  sir_epidemic h=1 stepmax=200 k=.3333 b=.5 N=7.9e6 mode=SIR |	
      xgraph n=200 nplot=3 d1=1 style=normal &			

  Normalized by N, with scaling of the output by N:		
  sir_epidemic h=1 scale=1 stepmax=200 k=.3333 b=.5 N=7.9e6 mode=SIR |
      xgraph n=200 nplot=3 d1=1 style=normal &

 The SRI model describes an epidemic in terms of
   s = susceptibles in a population
   i = infectives in a population
   r = removed = recovered + dead

   s0 = initial value of the susceptibles
   i0 = initial value of the infectives
   r0 = initial removed value = 0 usually
   
   s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = s0 + i0   = N for the unnormalized case.
   If normalized by total population N, then s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1 
   and s(t) starts at its maxium value of s0/N.   
   
   R0 = b*s0/k  = basic reproduction rate = b/k when s0=N  and s0=s0/N
   b = rate of infection
   k = rate removal = recovery rate + death rate
   xi = re-infection rate 
   mu = birth rate  
   nu = death rate
    
   The encounters between susceptibles and the infectives is represented
   by the product s*I  

  SIR model:  
	s'(t) =  - b*s(t)*i(t) 
	i'(t) = b*s(t)*i(t)- k*i(t) 
	r'(t) = k*i(t) 

  SIR model (with Baker 2020 reactive social distancing):  
   As infective number increases, social distancing increases and the 
   infectivity value b decreases.

	s'(t) =  - b*s(t)*i(t)/(1+gamma*i(t)) 
	i'(t) = b*s(t)*i(t)/(1+gamma*i(t)) - k*i(t) 
	r'(t) = k*i(t) 
    
  SIR model with vital statistics (mu birth rate, nu death rate):  
	s'(t) = mu - nu*s - b*s*i
	i'(t) = b*s*i - k*i - nu*i 
	r'(t) = k*i -  nu*r

  SIRS model with vital statistics (mu birth rate, nu death rate) and reinfection:  
	s'(t) = mu - nu*s + xi*r - b*s*i 
	i'(t) = b*s*i - k*i - nu*i 
	r'(t) = k*i - xi*r - nu*r

 s(t)= susceptible members 
 i(t)= infectives
 r(t)= removed members = recovered + dead + sequestered

 There is an impiled flow from s(t) -> i(t) -> r(t), though infected
 who are quarantined immediately become part of r(t). 

 The product xi*r are the reinfected members of the recovered group,
 and are thus removed from the recovered group and fed back to the
 susceptible group.
 
 The product b*s*i denotes the interaction of the infective population with
 the susceptible population..
