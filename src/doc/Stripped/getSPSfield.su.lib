  Description:                                                     *
      This function takes as input one single line record from an  *
    SPS file and extracts one single field from it.  The only      *
    supported records are point records 'R' or 'S' and the relation*
    record 'X'.                                                    *
                                                                   *
  Parameters:                                                      *
    char *Line :  line record to be processed.  First character    *
                  must be the label of one of supported records.   *
    const int rev :  SPS version being processed.  Supported:     *
                  0 - SPS revision 0.                              *
                  2 - SPS revision 2.1                             *
    int const idx  :  Index of the field to be extracted.  This is *
                  the item number as described by standard.        *
                  The label is item 0 (zero) and so one.           *
    void *addr     :  This is a pointer for the recovered item.    *
                  The item type must be according to the format    *
                  used by function, that differs from standard     *
                  for some fields.                                 *
                                                                   * 
                                                                   *
