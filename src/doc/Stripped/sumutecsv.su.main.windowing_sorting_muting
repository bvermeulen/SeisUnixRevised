               =1 Print INPUT mute functions. The cdp number and its        
                  input mute function values are printed. This print is     
                  not intended to be pretty. It just allows easy checking   
                  that the q-file contains the expected values.             
                  It also allows programmers and others to confirm that     
                  command line input via cdp=,offs=,tims= produces the      
                  same results as identical input via the qin= file.        

 Notes:								     

 The offsets specified in the offs array must be monotonically increasing.  

 For 3D, user needs to input mute locations (cdp numbers) which form aligned
 rectangles. That is, how-ever-many grid inlines the user chooses to put    
 mute locations on, there must always be the same number of mute locations  
 on each inline and those functions must be located at same grid crosslines.
 For instance, if user inputs locations for inline 7 at crosslines 15,25,40 
 then the user must input locations at crosslines 15,25,40 for any other    
 inlines that the user wants to supply locations for. (If user is lucky     
 enough that the grid has 100 inlines, then the input locations could be at 
 CDPs 715,725,740 and 1115,1125,1140 and 2015,2025,2040 and 2515,2525,2540. 
 Note that the CDP numbers specified on the cdp= parameter and also in the  
 input seismic trace cdp key are translated to inline and crossline numbers 
 using the input 3D grid definition - so those cdp numbers need to          
 correspond to the input 3D grid definition.                                

 For trace CDPs not listed in cdp= parameter or qin= file, bilinear         
 interpolation is done if the trace CDP location is surrounded by 4 mute    
 functions specified in the cdp= list. If the trace CDP is not surrounded   
 by 4 input mute functions, the result depends on the extrapi and extrapc   
 options. The result can be any combination of linear interpolation and     
 linear extrapolation and constant extrapolation. If input mute functions   
 are only located along 1 grid inline or 1 grid crossline, result is linear ", 
 interpolation in that direction (and linear or constant extrapolation      
 the outer ending functions).                                               

 The interpolation related to cdp is actually done after the interpolation  
 related to offset. That is, first the trace offset is used to compute times
 from the offs,tims arrays for 4, 2, or 1 mute functions and then weighting 
 based on the cdp locations of those mute functions is applied. Note also   
 that restricting the mute to the earliest and latest trace time is done    
 just before application to each trace. A consequence of this is that both  
 negative offs= and negative tims= values are allowed and honored even if   
 the abs= option is 1 (the default).

	 1. This program started as a copy of sunmocsv.c which itself
 	    started from sunmo.c (yes, NMO). The reason to do this is    
	    that sumute.c just has input parameters of tmute[],xmute[].     
	    For 3d muting, this program needs  cdp[], tims[][], offs[][].
          And, as it happens, sunmocsv.c has cdp[], tnmo[][], vnmo[][]. 
          So the easiest thing was to start from sunmocsv.c and 
	    rename input parameters. Parts of sumute.c were then copied
	    into this program (the code for ntaper= and mode=0,1,2,3).       
	    The mode=4 option/code was not copied to here since it does  
	    not seem to make sense combined with bilinear interpolation
	    of CDP mute function locations (but I could be wrong).          
	 2. Changed to expect milliseconds for all parameter inputs.               
	 3. Put in error checks to stop users from accidentally         
	    trying to use sumute parameter names.

        1. Reworked to use lib routines to get mute function values
           either from command line parameters or from input q-files.      
        2. Reworked to use lib routines for bilinear interpolation.
