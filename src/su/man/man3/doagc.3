.TH DOAGC 3SU SU
.SH NAME
.B doagc \-
apply automatic gain control to a data vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
void doagc(dataptr, agc, nt, ntr)
float *dataptr;
float agc;
int nfloat;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Doagc
applies automatic gain control to a data vector.
This version of "agc" uses a moving window that is Gaussian tapered.
.P
In the usual SU application, the data vector is created by concatenating
the data portions of a sequence of SEG-Y traces.
However, because the "agc" window would be anomolous if allowed to
cross from the tail of data originally on one trace to the
head of the data originally on the succceeding trace, the data vector is treated
essentially as a sequence of data traces with consequent loss of efficiency.
In many applications, direct use of suagc(1) or sugain(1) is more
convenient.
.P
This subroutine may be evoked in combination with other gain, scale or
balance parameters by calling it from gain(3SU).
.SH PARAMETERS

.I wagc
The agc window in samples.
