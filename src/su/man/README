Wow is this directory out of date.  Lots of name changes and the
err,ato,getpar stuff is now in par.

xxx.1, xxx.3, xxx.9 moved into ./man1, ./man3, ./man9 
by John on 14 Jun 1993 (makefile is now obsolete).

Note that on modern UNIX systems, it is possible
to put local man pages in /usr/local/man/man1 ... man2 ... etc.

The user may set the environment variable MANPATH,
to permit man to find local man pages
