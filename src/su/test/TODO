SU ----> virgil

In suaddnoise, sys calls random() -> rand() [didn't work on major]
Test suva (Jeff had some shell in the old test dir).
Test susort (need cshot -- see /data/jkc/Nmo/JOB>nmo)

susort.c:#define NTRSTEP	1024	/* realloc() increment measured in traces */
susort.c:		/* realloc if out of room */
susort.c:			val_list = (value *) erealloc(val_list, nv);


sucontour is a universe unto itself--hopefully Dave will rescue us from
such quagmires.

suintvel and sustkvel should be in par/main as plain intvel, stkvel, BUT
	maybe par/main/velconv does it all (can't figure out how to use it)


switch from fft, fftsep to fp_routines

get rid of lintrp, stretch in a myriad of Chris programs
similarly make fortran libs for those repeated subs in ./Subs
