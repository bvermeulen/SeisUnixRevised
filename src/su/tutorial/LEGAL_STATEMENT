Acknowledgements:
SU stands for Seismic Unix, a processing line developed at Colorado 
School of Mines, partially based on Stanford Exploration Project (SEP) 
software.

Einar Kjartansson, in cooperation with Shuki Ronen, wrote the first draft 
what is now called SU, while both were graduate students at Stanford 
University.  In turn, some of the fundamental concepts they implemented 
were formulated by their mentor, Jon Claerbout, Director of the Stanford 
Exploration Project.  Ronen brought this work to our Center during a two 
year stay here and, during this time, aided by Jack K. Cohen, began to turn 
SU into a supportable and exportable product.

Chris Liner, while a student at the Center, contributed to many of the 
graphics codes used in the pre-workstation (i.e., graphics terminal) age of 
SU.  Liner's broad knowledge of seismology and seismic processing enabled 
him to make a positive and continuing influence on the SU coding philosophy.
Dave Hale wrote several of the ``heavy duty'' processing codes as well as 
most of the core scientific and graphics libraries.  His knowledge of good 
C-language coding practice helped make our package a good example for 
applied computer scientists.

John Stockwell is largely responsible for designing the Makefile 
structure that makes the package easy to install on the majority of 
Unix platforms.

Thanks go to all the CWP students present and past and to many in the 
worldwide SU community who have contributed to the package.

In memoriam:
Jack K. Cohen passed away in October 1996.  He is greatly 
missed by all who had contact with him in the mathematical, geophysical, 
and SU-user communities.
