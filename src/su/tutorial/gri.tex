\opening{Dear Tim,}
Enclosed are five copies of the new SU User's Manual written under partial support from GRI.  We hope you like it!  Let us know if you would like to have additional copies.

Once again, we assure you that GRI support is a significant help to the SU project, and we are now laying the groundwork for major project extensions.  Moreover, the worldwide user community continues to grow---we enclose the updated list of verified installations.  
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
