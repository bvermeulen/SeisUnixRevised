IBM fortran doesn't accept underbars.  If your compiler insists on them,
the compiler error messages will probably be enough hint, but in Undermains
are (vastly out of date) codes with the underbars.  Use these to edit the
current versions--do NOT overwrite the current versions with them.

On RS6000, sumax drops core with -O, so recompiled -g.

suzoep isn't ready yet and probably shouldn't be in this directory anyway.
