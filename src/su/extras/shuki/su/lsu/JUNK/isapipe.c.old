/* isapipe - determine if file is a pipe from its file descriptor
 *
 * This routine is OBSOLETE.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	int: 1 = YES, 0 = NO
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *	int isapipe(fd)
 *	int fd;	  file descriptor
 *
 * Credits:
 *	SEP: Stew wrote unrelated versions to do the same thing
 *	CWP: Jack
 *	Rochkind, "Advanced UNIX Programming" points out that
 *		pipes are uniquely unnamed files (the kernel
 *		silently assigns an inode) and so have 0 links.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	This trivial routine is included only for compatiblity with
 *	SEP applications that might call it.  For the same reason,
 *	type it "int" instead of "bool."
