NAME
     pef - predictive error filtering

SYNOPSIS
     supef [options parameters] <stdin >stdout

DESCRIPTION
     supef performs a predictive deconvolution using the  predic-
     tive error filter operator constructed for each trace on the
     basis  of  its  autocorrelation.   The  autocorrelation   is
     estimated in the trace window specified by start time (msec)
     _s_a_t and end time(msec) _e_a_t. The filter design  is  controled
     by  white  noise percent (%) _p_w_n and by values of predictive
     lag (msec) _p_l_a_g and total operator length (msec) _t_o_l,  which
     describe an operator in the form:
                   { 1,0,0,0,0,0,d1,d2,d3,...,dN }
                     |-- plag -|
                     |----------- tol ---------|

OPTIONS
     -v          turn verbose on
                 (by default: off)

PARAMETERS
     plag=       predictive lag (msec)
                 (by default: one sampling interval -
                              - spiking deconvolution)

     tol=        total operator length (msec)
                 of predictive error filter
                 (by default: 120)

     pwn=        white noise percent (%)
                 (by default: 0.1)

     sat=  eat=  start and end time (msec) of the trace window
                 for autocorrelation computation
                 (by default: trace start and trace end time)

EXAMPLES
     supef -v tol=160 plag=32 sat=250 <data >decondata

     susort <data | sustack ... | supef >outdata
