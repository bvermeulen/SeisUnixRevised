I don't like if's and for's that look like functions:
	if(....)
What harminaspace?:
	if (....)
Spaces around =, + and - are nice too.  So are spaces after commas.

But no wrapped lines please.  This requirement occasionally persuades
me to delete a few spaces.  But I don't hesitate to break printfs like
	printf("loooooonnggggg formattttttttttttt\n", item1,
		item2, ....);

I like the layout:
	if (....) {
		stuff1
	} else if {
		stuff2
	} else {
		stuff3
	}
In a simple if-else with one statement per branch, I can see dispensing
with the braces.  But then again, it is a common error to add a statement
to such a branch later and forget the (now mandatory) braces, so I
recommend them as a reliability measure.

Similarly:
	for (...) {
		stuff
	}
The alternative style that seems popular is:
	for (...)
		{
		stuff
		}
	nextstatement
I don't like it.  Because to me the ideal language goes:
	for ....
		stuff
	endfor
and
	if ...
		stuff
	else
		morestuff
	endif
And the style I (and K&R) suggest is as close as I can come without
freaking people out with the preprocessor.
