czfilters:
Use of the programs in this directory requires that you have the CZ
suite compiled in a directory on your unix search path.  The CZ suite
is available to sponsors of the Consortium Project on Seismic Inverse
Methods for Complex Structure at the Center for Wave Phenomena in the
Colorado School of Mines.  Special arrangements can also be made for
certain academic users.

CZ is a post-stack inversion program, similar to Kirchhoff migration,
that admits a c(z) background velocity program and produces a reflector
map and zero-offset reflection coefficient estimates.  For further
information, see the documentation accompanying the CZ distribution
and the published article:

Cohen, J. K. and F. G. Hagin, 1985, Velocity inversion using a
    stratified reference: Geophysics, v. 50, n. 11, pp. 1689-1700.

This directory contains the source code and an example JOB file,
JOB.bench, for running CZ under the Seismic UNIX (SU) processing line.

Except for benchmarking, actual JOBs should be run in user directories
so that this directory remains uncluttered and able to serve as a
convenient place for first time users to peruse the benchmark example
setup.

-----------

Running the Benchmark Example:
The data and parameters are those from the first example in the
CZ User Manual (CWP-U06).

To run the benchmark example:
% JOB.bench

-----------
General use:

The user has to create a bare traces file.  For SEG-Y data, this could
be done by using sustrip, but here we use the synthetic data generator
supplied with the CZ suite and the user-supplied file:
datasyn

Also, the user has to supply two processing parameter files:
parcz1
parcz2

The commands:
% cz1fil
% cz2fil
supply full information on the parameters that may appear in these files.

Perusal of the JOB.bench file should reveal all remaining mysteries and
I suggest copying and cloning the following files in another directory
and running by making your JOB file executable.  Clone:
parcz1
parcz2
JOB.bench

and if running a synthetic with czsyn:
datasyn

-----------

Files in this directory (some are created by running JOB.bench):

BARE		Bare traces by cz3fil from CZ's final file (here, INVTRACES)
BOUNDS  	Limits file used by CZ suite
CZINFO  	Stdout from CZ suite
DATA		Input SEG-Y data (here from synthetic)
IMAGE		Output SEG-Y data
INVTRACES	CZ's final result file
Idle		Junk directory
JOB.bench	Executable JOB file for running benchmark example (ascii)
PTRACES		Intermediate data file created by CZ suite
RCS		Revision Control Source directory
READ-ME		This file
SYNINFO		Stdout from synthetic data generator
TRACES		Bare traces from synthetic data generator
comment		Used for "make record"
cz1fil.c	Creates data1in for CZ
cz2fil.c	Creates data2in for CZ
cz3fil.f	Makes BARE, paraddhead, parshw1, parshw2 (with sed)
data1in		Data file for CZ (here created automatically)
data2in		Data file for CZ (here created automatically)
datasyn		Data file for synthetic data generator
install		Marker file for makefile
makefile	Makefile
paraddhead	Params for making output SEG-Y data (created automatically)
parcz1		User supplied processing parameters (type "cz1fil" for info)
parcz2		User supplied processing parameters (type "cz2fil" for info)
parshw1		Params for making output SEG-Y data (created automatically)
parshw2		Params for making output SEG-Y data (created automatically)
print		Marker file for makefile
record		Record file created by "make record" after JOB.bench is run
