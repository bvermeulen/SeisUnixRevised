# ftn2c - convert common type of fortran data to c data
# Usage: ftn2c ns= <stdin >stdout
# Copyright 1990 by Jack K. Cohen
# CAVEAT: This is wildly inefficient, but I needed it one day and was
#	too tired to write C.  Someone should steal the half-dozen lines
#	needed from suaddhead & sustrip to implement this in C.
