These routines are supplied for systems that lack them.  If needed,
they should be added to the C library in ../lib and the makefile
there should be adjusted to compile them.

strchr (equivalent to BSD "index")
tmpfile (missing from many BSD-based Unixes)
tmpnam (missing from many BSD-based Unixes)

As of 11/27/88 these routines are used at CWP in
strchr  -	getpars.c, suedit.c
tmpfile - 	suflip.c
tmpnam  - 	segyread.c suedit.c sugain.c

These routines can be tested by:
% cc -DTEST progname.c
% a.out
