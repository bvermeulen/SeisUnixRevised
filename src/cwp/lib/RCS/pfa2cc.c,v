void pfa2cc (int isign, int idim, int n1, int n2, complex cz[])
/*****************************************************************************
Prime factor fft:  2-D complex to complex transforms, in place
******************************************************************************
Input:
isign       	sign of isign is the sign of exponent in fourier kernel
idim        	dimension to transform, either 1 or 2 (see notes)
n1          	1st (fast) dimension of array to be transformed (see notes)
n2          	2nd (slow) dimension of array to be transformed (see notes)
z           	array[n2][n1] of complex elements to be transformed in place

Output:
z		array[n2][n1] of complex elements transformed
******************************************************************************
Notes:
Only one (either the 1st or 2nd) dimension of the 2-D array is transformed.

If idim equals 1, then n2 transforms of n1 complex elements are performed; 
else, if idim equals 2, then n1 transforms of n2 complex elements are 
performed.

Although z appears in the argument list as a one-dimensional array,
z may be viewed as an n1 by n2 two-dimensional array:  z[n2][n1].

Let n denote the transform length, either n1 or n2, depending on idim.
Then, n must be factorable into mutually prime factors taken 
from the set {2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16}.  in other words,
    n = 2**p * 3**q * 5**r * 7**s * 11**t * 13**u
where
    0 <= p <= 4,  0 <= q <= 2,  0 <= r,s,t,u <= 1
is required for pfa2cc to yield meaningful results.  this
restriction implies that n is restricted to the range
    1 <= n <= 720720 (= 5*7*9*11*13*16)

To perform a two-dimensional transform of an n1 by n2 complex array 
(assuming that both n1 and n2 are valid "n"), stored with n1 fast 
and n2 slow:  pfa2cc(isign,1,n1,n2,z);  pfa2cc(isign,2,n1,n2,z);
