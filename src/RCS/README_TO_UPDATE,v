@README_TO_UPDATE 			                5 April 1999

Responding to a request from some users for an incremental update feature,
I have created a tarfile called update.yy.to.xx.tar.Z. This upgrades the
previous release yy to the current release xx.  This is experimental.

Instructions for updating your release from release yy to release xx:

1) Make a backup copy of your Makefile.config. You need to use
   the new Makefile.config that is in the update.yy.to.xx.tar.Z file,
   but saving the old one will give you clues to setting up the
   new one.

2) Begin with the compressed tarfile   'update.yy.to.xx.tar.Z' and
   the file 'update.list' in the directory /your/root/path. The contents
   update.yy.to.xx.tar.Z will overwrite the  /your/root/path/src directory.

3) Check the file 'update.list' to see what files have been updated.
   If you have modified any of these files --back them up-- before beginning
   the update. All files in update.list will be overwritten. This is
   of particular importance to users who have had to modify Makefiles
   in the previous distributions.

4) Make sure that all files contained in /your/root/path/src are chmoded
   writable by the user doing the update. If this is not the case, the
   update will not work.

   % cd /your/root/path

   Uncompress and untar the file update.yy.to.xx.tar.Z via the command:
   % zcat update.yy.to.xx.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

5) Restore any files saved in step 2).  You should be able to make any
   changes to the Makefiles globally by editing the single file:
   Makefile.config
  
   When you are sure that everything is compatible with your system:
   type:   make remake   (to remake the basic set of codes)
           make xtremake (to remake the X-toolkit applications)
           make finstall (to install the Fortran codes)
           make mglremake (to install the Mesa/ Open GL items)
           make uremake  (to remake libcwputils.a)(nonessential)
           make xmremake (to remake the Motif-based applications)


6) Troubleshooting. 

   What if you have "blown it" completely? Fear not. Simply pull over
   the current versions of  cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z, untar_me_first.xx.tar.Z,
   and README_BEFORE_UNTARRING and do the install again from scratch.
   This process has been simplified greatly from the previous versions
   of the codes, so this is not as big a deal as in old releases.
