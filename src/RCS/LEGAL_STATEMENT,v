Acknowledgements:

SU stands for Seismic Unix, a processing line developed at
the Colorado School of Mines, partially based on Stanford
Exploration Project (SEP) software.

Einar Kjartansson, in cooperation with Shuki Ronen, wrote
the first draft what is now called SU, while both were 
graduate students at Stanford University.  In turn, some of
the fundamental concepts they implemented were formulated
by their mentor, Jon Claerbout, Director of the Stanford
Exploration Project.  Ronen brought this work to our Center
during a two year stay here and, during this time, aided
by Jack K. Cohen, began to turn SU into a supportable
and exportable product.

Chris Liner, while a student at the Center, wrote most of
the graphics codes used in the pre-workstation (i.e,
graphics terminal) age of SU.  Liner's broad knowledge of
seismology and seismic processing enabled him to make a
positive and continuing influence on the SU coding philosophy.

Dave Hale wrote several of the ``heavy duty'' processing
codes as well as most of the core scientific and graphics
libraries.  His knowledge of good C-language coding practice
helped make our package a good example for applied computer
scientists.

John Stockwell is largely responsible for designing the
Makefile structure that makes the package easy to install
on the majority of Unix platforms.

Thanks also to all the CWP students present and past and to
many in the worldwide SU community who have contributed
to the package.

In memorium: Jack K. Cohen passed away in October 1996. He
will surely be missed by all who had contact with him in the
mathematical, geophysical, and SU-user communities.
