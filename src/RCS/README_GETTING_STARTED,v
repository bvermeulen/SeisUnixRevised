@README for  GETTING STARTED with the CWP/SU codes.	  5 April 1999

The package does not contain UNIX man pages. However, the codes
are self-documented in an equivalent fashion.

selfdocs -- the majority of the CWP/SU programs will return a brief
	    description of what they do and how to run them by typing
	    the name of the program on the commandline of a Unix
	    terminal window, with no options specified.

suhelp --- make a listing by code catagory and list other helpful programs
suname --- list the names an a 1 line description of the codes
sufind --- search for patterns in selfdocs
sudoc --- list self doc information by program name 

all permit the user to gather information regarding the codes in
an online fashion. You can send the output to your laser printer via:

% suhelp | lpr      ("lpr" is your standard printer command)
% suname | lpr      ("lpr" is your standard printer command)

Demos:
In the subdirectories of the $CWPROOT/src/demos  directory
there are demos for many CWP/SU programs. These demos are
ready-to-run shell scripts that can be used as a basis for
building your own processing sequences.

FAQs:
When SU users ask questions about the functionality and usage
of the CWP/SU package, I place those questions, with answers
in files in the directory: $CWPROOT/src/faq.

Manual:
The SU Manual is also included in   documentation.xx.tar.Z.

As always, feel free to ask for help with installation or usage.

Future plans:
There is the beginnings of a 'demos' directory that will contain
shell scripts for seismic processing sequences. There isn't
much there yet, but we plan more for future releases. This
is intended to replace and expand on the example shell scripts
that are in ../src/su/examples, but be true demos that
require little or no preparation by the user to execute.

There is also the beginning of a list of frequently asked questions
in the CWPROOT/src/faq.
