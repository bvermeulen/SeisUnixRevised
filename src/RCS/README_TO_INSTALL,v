@README_TO_INSTALL  the CWP/SU  Free Software Release 33      5 April 1999

Disclaimer: 
There are no guarantees, explicit or implicit, made by the Center for 
Wave Phenomena, the Colorado School of Mines, or any member of the 
aforesaid organizations, past, present, or future, regarding the accuracy,
safety, usefulness, or any other quality or aspect of this software.

*Please read the file LEGAL_STATEMENT for a full description of 
the user license and legal restrictions for this software package.*


This file begins with a brief description of the installation procedure
followed by a more detailed discussion of each step.

### Brief description of the installation procedure:
### Be sure to read the more detailed list that follows this one.

Installing the codes is 7 basic steps:
1) read the README's before unbundling cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z

2) don't install as 'root' (the superuser) (It is possible to damage
   a system's file structure if the install is not done properly.)

3) begin with the compressed tarfile cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z in
   /your/root/path

4) set the CWPROOT environment variable to  CWPROOT=/your/root/path
   
5) put /your/root/path/bin on your working shell path

6) uncompress and untar the compressed tarfile via:
   zcat cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z | tar -xvf -
   The code will appear as the single directory  /your/root/path/src

7) compile codes via:
        cd /your/root/path/src
   1) edit the file   /your/root/path/src/Makefile.config 
      to agree with the needs of your system.
   2) type: 
           make install   (to install the basic set of codes)
           make xtinstall (to install the X-toolkit applications)
           make finstall (to install the Fortran codes)
           make mglinstall (to install the Mesa/ Open GL items)
           make utils     (to install libcwputils) (nonessential) 
           make xminstall (to install the Motif application)(nonessential)

or if remaking:
      type: make remake   (to remake the basic set of codes)
           make xtremake (to remake the X-toolkit applications)
           make finstall (to install the Fortran codes)
           make mglremake (to install the Mesa/ Open GL items)
           make uremake  (to remake libcwputils.a)(nonessential)
           make xmremake (to remake the Motif-based applications)


You may have to do some hacking along the way, if the codes
fail to compile the first time through. In this event, you
may simply type "make" in the directory where you were modifying
code. If code appears to have been missed, you may need to
use the "remaking" options. 

A screen dump of a successfull install of the current version
of the codes on an IBM RS6000 is located in the file: "install.successfull"

   Note: none of these files is absolutely comprehensive. We rely on
   user supplied information for porting the codes to other platforms
   (such as HP, DEC, Silicon Graphics, Convex, Cray, etc.),
   so your comments are important in helping us keep the installation
   process as simple as possible.

2) We advise that you do *not* try to install the CWP/SU codes as "root"
   as a safety feature, though precautions have been taken to keep
   the codes from installing in "root" areas. Install the codes as a
   "regular user", not the superuser.

   At least 2 users have reported that they have corrupted their file
   systems, while installing under Linux because they ignored this
   warning. So, we warned you.

3) Begin with the compressed tarfile  cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z in
   files in /your/root/path

   A) Create a directory with some path that we will call "/your/root/path".
      We don't mean that the directory path be literally called
      "/your/root/path". It can be any convenient path on your system.
      You may need the system administrator on your site to set up such
      a directory if it is not in subdirectory owned by you.

      /your/root/path should be chmoded to be writable by the "regular" 
      user who is performing the install.
 
      Finding a good location for the codes to reside on your system is
      important. When the codes are uncompressed, untarred, and compiled 
      they take up about 10 megabytes. So you should put the codes in an 
      area where this much space is available.
 
   B) About /your/root/path:
 
      The Makefiles throughout the CWP codes operate on the assumption
      that the directories containing the include files, libraries, and
      executable codes will be installed under a central root path
      of the form of  /your/root/path. When you unbundle 
      the compressed tarfile  cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z in /your/root/path,
      the directory /your/root/path/src will appear, containing all
      the source code.
 
      Many of the shell scripts used in the package depend on accessing
      the source code, so sticking to this convention is necessary for
      correct operation of the package.
 
      When you compile the codes:
      the "libraries" will be installed in /your/root/path/lib, 
      the "include files" will be installed in /your/root/path/include,
      and the "executable files" will be installed in /your/root/path/bin.
 
      You may choose  /your/root/path to be anything that is most convenient
      for you and compatible for your system, provided that /your/root/path
      exists and is chmoded to be writable by the user installing the CWP codes.
      (Again, for safety, don't try to install the codes as "root".)
 
      Examples of /your/root/path:

    		/usr/local/cwp
    		/Users/harry/cwp
    		/u/user/bob/scratch/codes
    		/scratch/bob/csm
    
      However, if for some reason you cannot have the CWP source codes
      immediately under /your/root/path, then it is still possible
      install the codes successfully.

   NOTE: If for some reason the CWP source code cannot be placed immediately
        under /your/root/path on your system, for example:
        if the source code is in:  /Users/bob/stuff/cwp/src 
        but the user wants to install the stuff under another path
        for example:   /system/local 
        Then the user would define: CWPROOT to be /system/local
 
        To make the source code appear to be in /system/local/src,
        a symbolic link pointing from /Users/bob/stuff/cwp/src to
        /system/local/src may be made via the command:
 
                    ln -s /Users/bob/stuff/src /system/local/src

 
   Warning: If you are unfamiliar with symbolic links, please consult
            your local UNIX guru.

    
4) Setting the necessary environment variable  CWPROOT.
    
   All of the Makefiles imbedded in the CWP codes depend on there being
   defined in the users' working shell environment a variable called
   "CWPROOT" that is set to the value of /your/root/path. This permits
   the Makefiles to install the libraries in /your/root/path/lib,
   the include files in /your/root/path/include, and the executables in
   /your/root/path/bin without forcing the user to manually edit all
   (60+) Makefiles.
   
   C Shell or TCSH shell:
 	For a user of C Shell (csh) (or tcsh) the CWPROOT environment variable
   is set by adding the line
 
   setenv CWPROOT /your/root/path
 
   in his or her  .cshrc file and relogging.
 
   Korn Shell, Born Shell, and BASH
 	For a user of Korn Shell (csh) (or Born Shell (sh)
         or Bourne Again Shell (bash) ) 
   the CWPROOT environment variable is set by adding the line
 
   export CWPROOT=/your/root/path
 
   in his or her  .profile file and relogging.

   To see if you have done this correctly, type:
   echo $CWPROOT
   The value of /your/root/path should be returned.
 
5) Put /your/root/path/bin in your working shell path. This must be
   done so your working shell can find the executables.

   In C shell (csh or tcsh) this is done by modifying the set path line:
   set path=( /your/root/path/bin ~/bin /usr/local/bin /bin  ....)
   (You just add /your/root/path/bin to the list of stuff that is already
    there.)

   in the user's  .cshrc file. 
   (C shell users will need to remember to relog to get these changes
    to take effect and 'rehash' after compiling the codes, so that your
    working shell will be able to find the executables.)

   In Korn (ksh), Bourne (sh), or Bourne Again (bash)  Shells, modify
   the line:

   export PATH=:/your/root/path/bin:$HOME/bin:/bin:/usr/bin: ...etc...

   (You just add /your/root/path/bin to the list of other stuff that is
    already there.)
   in the user's  .profile file. You will need to relog.
   
   If you don't have a line like this in your .profile, then you may need
   to ask a Unix guru for help. If you don't have such a person at
   your site, then you may need to see the files in /etc/ which set up
   the general profile for all sh, bash, or ksh on your system.

 	   
6) Untarring and uncompressing the compressed tarfiles. 
 
    IMPORTANT: Begin the installation by uncompressing and untarring
    cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z /your/root/path
    (see the discussion in 3) of this file for more info
    about /your/root/path). (The "xx" is the current Release number.)
 
    You may uncompress and untar the codes manually via the command:
 
 	zcat cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z | tar -xvf -
 
    This method preserves cwp.su.all.xx.tar.Z in its original form,
    in the event you have to start over.

    If you are installing on a Linux system and can't seem to find
    zcat, then you have not installed all of the operating system.
    You still probably need to do the 'ap' install.
 
7) Compiling the codes.
 	
    One master Makefile is provided to compile the codes.
    Note, this file will refuse to compile the codes if the
    CWPROOT environment variable is not set.
    See step 2) of these instructions for information about the CWPROOT
    environment variable. Read this file carefully before proceeding.

    The file  "Makefile.config" is provided to permit the user to make
    global changes to the "make" proceedure, without having to edit
    any of the Makefiles. Read this file and make whatever changes are
    necessary for compatibility with your system.
 
You will then compile the codes by typing:

	make install   ----  to install the cwp, plot, and su packages
	make xtinstall ----  to install the X windows codes
	make xminstall ----  to install the Motif based codes

If you have to recompile along the way 
	type:

	make remake    ---- to recompile the cwp, plot, and su packages
	make xtinstall ---- to recompile the X-Toolkit based codes
	make xminstall ---- to recompile the Motif based codes


You may have to do some hacking along the way, if the codes
fail to compile the first time through. Hacking may entail
making changes in the actual programs. You may have to change
the include and/or link paths in the X-windows directories.
Therefore, it is a good idea to do each of these makes separately,
rather than trying to do them all in one shot via a command like:

*Don't* do this==>> % make install ; make xtinstall ; make xminstall  

Some of the directories contain Portability subdirectories. There
may be variations on the codes in there that you can implement to get the
codes to compile. We have made most of the portability directories
unnecessary via the magic of compile time flags.

Questions regarding the installation and portability should be addressed to:
