CWP Software Update: CWP/SU Release 32: 21 July 1998  (32th edition)

The CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x package is the world's most widely used
free seismic research and processing software environment.
There have been more than 1400 verified installs of SU in
50 countries worldwide.

New, Continued, and Expanded Support:
================================================================
I would like to thank the Society of Exploration Geophysicists for
the expanded support through a generous grant from the SEG Foundation!

I would also like to thank the Gas Research Institute for its 
support for Seismic Unix for the past year.

My thanks also goes to the Consortium Project on Seismic Inverse
Methods for Complex Structures at the Center for Wave Phenomena
for its continuing financial support of the SU project.

New codes:
================================================================
prestack finite-difference migration
prestack PSPI migration
prestack Fourier finite-difference migration
prestack split-step migration
3D  V(z) common offset inversion (migration) (beta version)

The Seismic Unix Project depends heavily on contributed code
extensions and bug fixes from the SU users community.

Thank you, to all who have helped make CWP/SU Release 32 the best
release so far!

PS:  The Society of Exploration Geophysicists Annual Meeting will
     be held in New Orleans, the week of 13 September 1998.  I
     don't have a booth, but will be spending a lot of time
     walking the convention floor, shaking hands, and meeting with
     current and potential SU users. I hope to see you there!
