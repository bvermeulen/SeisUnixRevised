About the CWP/SU codes.
The CWP/SU package is a free software package created
at the Center for Wave Phenomena, Colorado School of Mines.
The package may be viewed as an "instant (exploration) 
seismic research and processing environment" for UNIX-based machines.

The CWP/SU codes are a major part of our day-to-day working environment
here a the Center for Wave Phenomena.  As such, this package 
is different from other free software you will encounter.
Unlike other free software packages, the source code is intrinsic
to the operation of the CWP/SU environment. Do not assume that
the source code can be thrown away after the package is compiled.
Plan to keep the source code.


The package contains tools for:
       reading/writing tapes in the SEG-Y format
       manipulating seismic data in the SEG-Y format
       Fourier transforms
       filtering
       synthetic data generation
       seismic migration
       NMO
       DMO
       PostScript Graphics
       X-windows Graphics
	.. etc

What you need to install the codes:
       You will need a machine running the UNIX operating system.
       The code takes up about 8 megabytes after installation
       and compilation.

The codes have been successfully installed on:
