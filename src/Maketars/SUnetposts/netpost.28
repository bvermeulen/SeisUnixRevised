About the CWP/SU codes (Seismic Un*x):
================================================================
The CWP/SU package is a free software package created
at the Center for Wave Phenomena, Colorado School of Mines.
The package may be viewed as an "instant (exploration) 
seismic research and processing environment" for UNIX-based machines.

The CWP/SU codes are a major part of our day-to-day working environment
here a the Center for Wave Phenomena.  As such, this package 
is different from other free software you will encounter.
Unlike other free packages, the source code is intrinsic
to the operation of the CWP/SU environment. Do not assume that
the source code can be thrown away after the package is compiled.
Plan to keep the source code.

The package performs a large collection of common seismic
processing and seismic research related functions and
has been installed on all major Unix-based platforms.

We have over 500 verified install sites in 32 countries!
