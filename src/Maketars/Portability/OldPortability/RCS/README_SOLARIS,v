@README  SOLARIS						21 June 1995

On most systems, the compiler you want to use is:
/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc

However, you may also use gcc.


In Makefile.config
Use:
# The following OPTC should be used under Solaris
OPTC = -O -D_solaris_2_x_  -DSUN

The -DSUN flag is necessary for the programs "suinterp" and
"suradon" to work properly.

# C compiler
CC = /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc

or

CC = /the/path/to/gcc

where /the/path/to is the actual path to gcc.

#Load link path
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /lib/path1:/lib/path2:   etc...

where the /lib/path's are the list of appropriate library link
paths for your compiler, including X-windows paths. This is
often set as a shell environment variable, rather than explicitly
set in Makefile.config.

# uncomment this to add  $(CWPROOT)/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH += $(CWPROOT)/lib

# to use this line for RANLIB (also for SOLARIS)
RANLIB = ar -ts

# use this under SOLARIS, if using the native C compiler
CPP = /usr/ccs/lib/cpp

# X11 include path
IX11 = /usr/openwin/include

# X11 library path
LX11 = /usr/openwin/lib

Solaris is a strict System V UNIX system with an ANSI C compiler.
Most other items should compile ok.

Many thanks to Dave Holmgren of the   Department of Astronomy,
University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario  and to
Paul Docherty of the Bullard Laboratories at Cambridge University,
for help in updating this file. Thanks also to Tony Kocurko
of the Memorial University of Newfoundland for the original information
on Solaris installs.

Please feel free to email me with questions or comments concerning
the codes.


Thanks to Lorraine Wolff of Auburn for the following report.
>I can't get the code to compile because my compiler can't find
> "bzero" or "bcopy"--how can  I fix this?

We try to keep to the ANSI standard, but sometimes old
style calls creep in. The problem of rooting these things out
is exacerbated because many systems still support the old style calls.

If you have trouble installing
because your compiler can't find "bcopy" or "bzero"
make the following replacements.

Replace all statements of the form

bzero( a, b);

with statements of the form:

memset( (void *) a , (int) '\0', b );

Please replace all instances
of statements of the form of:

bcopy ( a , b, c);

with a statements of the form:

memcpy( (void *) b, (const void *) a, c );
