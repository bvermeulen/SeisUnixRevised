CWP/SU Release 21.
Installation instructions for Trane.

I am assuming that /your/root/path is /usr/local/cwp.

1) Move old  /usr/local/cwp/src  out of the way or remove.

2) Make sure there is no floppy diskette in the drive.

3) Type the following:
% cd /usr/local/cwp
% tar -xvf /dev/rfd0b       ---- you will be prompted for the diskette

The files:

README_BEFORE_UNTARRING 
untar_me_first_21.tar.Z
cwp.su.all.21.tar.Z


will appear in the current working directory.

4) Read README_BEFORE_UNTARRING and proceed according to
   the instructions.

5) To eject the floppy, type:

% /usr/etc/disk -e /dev/rfd0b

(you may have this aliased to 'eject' from the last time we did this)
