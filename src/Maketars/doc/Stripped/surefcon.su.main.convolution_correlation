 SUREFCON -  Convolution of user-supplied Forward and Reverse		
		refraction shots using XY trace offset in reverse shot	

	surefcon <forshot sufile=revshot  xy=trace offseted  >stdout	

 Required parameters:						 	
 sufile=	file containing SU trace to use as reverse shot		
 xy=		Number of traces offseted from the 1st trace in sufile	

 Optional parameters:						 	
 none								 	

 Trace header fields accessed: ns					
 Trace header fields modified: ns					

 Notes:								
 This code implements the Refraction Convolution Section (RCS)	method	
 of generalized reciprocal refraction traveltime analysis developed by 
 Derecke Palmer and Leoni Jones.					

 The time sampling interval on the output traces is half of that on the
 traces in the input files.		  	

 Example:								

	 surefcon <DATA sufile=DATA xy=1 | ...				

 Here, the su data file, "DATA", convolved the nth trace by		
 (n+xy)th trace in the same file

  CAVEATS: no space-variable or time-variable capacity.
	The more than one trace allowed in sufile is the
	beginning of a hook to handle the spatially variant case.
