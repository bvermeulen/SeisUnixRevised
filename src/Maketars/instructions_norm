CWP/SU Release 26.
Installation instructions for Cauchy.

1) Become the superuser and 
# mkdir  /usr/local/cwp
# chown  norm  /usr/local/cwp

2) Stop being the superuser.
If there is a diskette in the drive, eject it now.
Now type:

% cd  /usr/local/cwp
% tar  -xvf  /dev/rfd0b   (the machine will prompt you to insert the diskette)
% /usr/etc/disk  -e  /dev/rfd0b       (to eject the floppy after it is read)

Repeat this procedure to read both diskettes.
 

3) Read the file  README_BEFORE_UNTARRING and  proceed as directed.
