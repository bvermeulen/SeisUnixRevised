Notes
-----
This example plots the model and quits.

(1) The file simplemodel describes the model here.  Notice that you have
to provide a description of the upper surface now as well.
Also, an interface description is terminated by a large
negative z coordinate (-99999. for example).

(2) You are given control, to some extent, of the colors
in the plot (more control to come in the future).  The colors
are specified in file plotcolors here. (You might find that not all
the colors are working as advertised, ie, as specified by the key.)

(3) To get a plot of the model enter m (or M) in record 3.
To plot the model and then quit, as is done here, enter mq.

Update: Because of problems with high optimization, it has been
found to be necessary to put in dummy versions of certain parameter
files which are not used for this particular demo.
