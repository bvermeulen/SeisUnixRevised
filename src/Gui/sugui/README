     the category list shown on the left panel. Once the
     list of applications of the selected category pops up,
     click twice on the application name you wish to insert
     in the current sequence.

2.- Clicking twice on an application's icon will bring up a window to
    enter parameters for that application.

3.- Shell button executes the sequence (opens a terminal)

  Note: the same sequence can be loaded many times. A new name will be
	given every time.
