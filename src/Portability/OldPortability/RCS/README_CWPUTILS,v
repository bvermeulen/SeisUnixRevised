Some additional utilities have been included in a separate
library called   libcwputils.a

To compile this library, type:

		make utils

The current contents of this library are the subroutines:

cpusec()
cputime()
wallsec()
walltime()

Changes to be made for installation under SOLARIS.
--- ./cwputils/lib/cputime.c
Replace:
#if (_IBMR2||__hp9000s800)
#define CLOCK_UNIT	1000000
#else
#define CLOCK_UNIT	_SC_CLK_TCK
#endif
  
With:
#if (_IBMR2||__hp9000s800)
#define CLOCK_UNIT	1000000
#else
#define CLOCK_UNIT	CLK_TCK
#endif


It would be helpful if a SOLARIS user could supply us with a 
SOLARIS reserved variable so that the above fix could be made
once and for all in the #ifdef...#endif  in 
the source code for "cputime.c".

These subroutines are useful for checking the run time of code.
We have split these off from libcwp.a because of transportability
difficulties. To use these subroutines,  you will need to
link to  libcwputils.a when you compile your code.
