	This is the root directory for distributed Seismic Unix (dsu)


1.- Files in this directory:
  
  DSURC: used to setup the env variables necessary to run dsu
  
  README: this file
  
  LEGAL_STATEMENT and license
  
  Makefile.config: Modifications to $CWPROOT/src/Makefile.conf
		   This file is include by DSU subdirectories Makefiles

2.- Directories below this one:

  gui: 	  Contains the graphic user interface (GUI). You need to install
	  PVM3 and TCL/TK before compiling the GUI. Configure the file
	  ./gui/Makefile before running make INSTALL.

  graphics: Contains Makefiles to compile graphic applications

  lib:	  Distributed seismic unix library

  main:	  Contains a Makefile to compile the SU source codes as DSU modules

  main_dst: Contains PVM based applications


3.- Steps to install

  (a) This software requires: (NOTE THE VERSION NUMBERS !!!!)

	 SU V28.
	 PVM3.10
	 TCL7.4/TK4.0


  (b) Obtain the tar file with dsu (dsusrc.tar.gz)

  (c) cd $CWPROOT/src

  (d) Untar dsusrc.tar.gz (this creates the directory: $CWPROOT/src/dsu)

	gunzip -c dsusrc.tar.gz | tar xvf -

  (e) cd dsu (or cd $CWPROOT/src/dsu)

  (f) Make sure the following env variables are set:
	
	CWPROOT  (CWP SU main directory) 
	PVM_ROOT (PVM main directory) 
	PVM_ARCH (PVM main directory) 

  (g) Customize the file Makefile.config (check the CTARGET for your machine)

  (h) Make sure the pointers to TCL and TK are correct in the file:
      $CWPROOT/src/dsu/gui/Makefile. Set up the variable TCLTKROOT.


  (i) Type: make INSTALL


4.- To use dsu, follow these steps:

  (a) Customize the file: $CWPROOT/src/dsu/DSURC
  
  (b) Add the following line to your .cshrc file:

	source $CWPROOT/src/dsu/DSURC
  
  (c) type: dsu
