	Simple Guide to add an application (application_name) to DSU:


1.- Add the application name in the appropriate Makefile:

	- $CWPROOT/src/dsu/main  (Regular SU applications)
	- $CWPROOT/src/dsu/main_dst (PVM based applications)
	- $CWPROOT/src/dsu/graphic/xplot (X-window based appl)
	- $CWPROOT/src/dsu/graphic/psplot (PostScript based appl)

2.- Let DSU know about this application by adding a line in the file
    "$CWPROOT/src/dsu/gui/applinfo.list", with the following format

	help_file_name:n:source_code_directory

	WHERE:
	  
	(A) help_file_name is given following SU help naming convention:
	    application_name.su.main, or 
	    application_name.su.graphics.xplot, or
	    application_name.su.graphics.psplot

 	(B) N is :

	    4: regular SU applications
	    2: applications requiring X-windows capabilities

	(C) source_code_directory:

		This directory name is concatenated to $CWPROOT/src
		to locate the source code of the application.

3.- Generate the "parameter file" for this application in the directory
    .../dsu/dsupars:

	- Make argfiles

	- type: argfiles < application_source_code > help_file_name


    Note: The program "argfiles" attemps to extract from the source code
	  of an application, all the parameters it requires.
	  However, in a few cases, I have found that some parameter files 
	  are incomplete or have the same entry duplicated. Please, edit the 
	  output file to check if all the parameters have been extracted.
