	This makefile put some *.h files in front when compiling
	some SU applications. It looks for the source code in:
		$CWPROOT/src/su/main
	and let the excutables in the directory:
		$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH

	When linking, the library libdsu.a is put ahead of the
	regular SU libraries. 

	This Makefile can be used to compile SU applications
	that use "gettr/puttr". It will fail compiling applications
	non including "segy.h".


	Additionally it defines the macro: DO_GLOBALS 
	(see dsuglobvars.h)
