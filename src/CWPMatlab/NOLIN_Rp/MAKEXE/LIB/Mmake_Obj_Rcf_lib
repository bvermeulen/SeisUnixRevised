# This is a shell script to create an M_to_C library "libObj_Rcf". 
#
# Before linking and executing the library with a main routine, 
# make sure that the current directory is set properly in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# environment variable.
#
# The library is created with the maximum optimization <default>. If any
# optimization is unwanted, use the option -O on the command line to
# make appropriate changes <and in the option file in .matlab/R12 - or create a new
# one in the current directory and use -f option with the mcc -M option>, 
# or use -g option for debugging, which switches off all optimizations. 
# Also, non of the included routines uses a handle 
# to a graphic function, neither the functions "feval" nor "eval" are used
# while the routine is called. If this is the case, the compilation should be
# performed with the "%#function <list>" pragma on the command line, where
# <list> lists the corresponding routines. 
#
# THIS LIBRARY CONTAINES MANY USER-WRITTEN ROUTINES AS WELL AS SOME STANDART
# MATLAB ROUTINES COLLECTED FROM STANDART MATLAB LIBRARIES (CONTAINED IN 
# Obj_Rcf_src.tar).
