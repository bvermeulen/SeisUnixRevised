Contents of this directory are Matlab packages to perform the following
tasks.

NOLIN_Rp, Petr Jilek, (NOnLinear Inversion of Rp reflection coefficients) 
          package 

REFLCOEF, Petr Jilek, displacement reflection coefficients at a planar interface
          and reflectivity modeling for P incident on anisotropic media
          (up to monoclinic) having a horizontal symmetry plane.

LIN_Rp, Petr Jilek, joint linear inversion of approximate PP and PS wave 
          reflection coefficients: current version designed for 
          anisotropic media including isotropic, HTI, VTI,  and 
          orthorhombic symmetry.

Multi_Comp_Stack_Vel_Tomo, Vladimir Grechka and Andres Pech, joint 
	tomographic inversion of the NMO ellipses, reflection slopes, and
          zero-offset traveltimes of PP- and SS-waves. 

PSV_SlipMod1D, Matt Haney,  codes designed to model coupled P-SV plane 
         waves in a generally heterogeneous isotropic medium 
         with randomly placed linear slip fractures and either 
         free or absorbing boundary conditions. This code may 
         be useful for full-waveform synthetic seismogram 
         modeling and AVO studies.

Art_Matlab_core, Vladimir Grechka, codes for anisotropic elastic Asymptotic Ray Theory
         (ray theory) modeling

Asymmetry_PS, Pawan Dewangan, codes for PS asymetry modeling and data processing.
