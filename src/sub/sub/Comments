// things we might want:

#pragma stack 1000000
#pragma code 100000
#include "this.ufh"

Should we dump the shell comment convention?  Would let us use cpp (if it
accepts //).

Should we dump assignment as a value?  Probably not.

Constant elements in the symbol table should be tagged to prevent
assignment (does the grammar prevent this?).

Subrange into a HLH isn't implemented.

Tr.Series = 0	works as a vector - because of member access
q = 0		makes q a 0 no matter what was there before.
