Attached is a sub.uue which (I hope) is ready to distribute.  Also
attached (before the distribution) is a copy of the ReadMe.  When time
permits would you please stick sub.uue in some visible place and send
a copy of the ReadMe to your mailing list?  Thank you.

It's probably worth noting that Sub should (ha!) compile OK under
SunOS 4.1, SysV R4.2 (UnixWare), Linux, and NextStep (is that the
correct name?).  (It will almost surely turn out that the very last
keystroke I made in packing the distribution has broken it on all
conceivable platforms.)  Anyway, it should be approached with a sense
of adventure.  Mail problems, etc, to martin@ner.com for the time
being.
